Cloud Analytic Tools
====================

# Abstract


The Serene Software team proposes to develop a set of analytical tools for cloud scale data that can be composed into workflows or used independently.  The tool set will enable Intelligence Community analysts to modify analytic tools in the field to keep up with high operational tempo and deliver full capabilities of a cloud computing architecture.  Our approach builds on Free Open Source Software (FOSS) projects for cloud computing and data analytics, likely using Apache Hadoop at its core.  Hadoop is built on the MapReduce algorithm invented by Google for large-scale, reliable, inexpensive analytics.  Our commercialization strategy in Phases II and III includes contributing project changes back to the open source projects used and building a set of related proprietary technical services.  Our approach enables other agencies and corporations to leverage this investment and more easily benefit from these efforts.  The projectâ€™s technical rigor and commercial applicability will be augmented through review by Dr. Csaba Egyhazy and commercialization and technical guidance from our advanced industry partners.  In Phase I, we will establish the foundation for further development and technology transfer at the completion of Phase II.  The Serene Software team will work closely with OSD and the program offices during Phases I and II to ensure that we are responsive to DoD needs.
