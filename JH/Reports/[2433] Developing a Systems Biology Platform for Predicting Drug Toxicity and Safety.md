Developing a Systems Biology Platform for Predicting Drug Toxicity and Safety
=============================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
Adverse drug reactions  ADRs   more commonly known as drug side effects  are estimated to cause over
        deaths in the US annually  are responsible for      of all hospital admissions  and     of clinical trial
failures  Current pharmacological modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry  such as
PK PD  are generally empirical at the biomolecular level  meaning simplified mathematical terms are used to
represent complex physiology  These modeling approaches are used to quantitatively understand therapeutic
exposure response relationships for clinical dosing  but have been less commonly applied to describe
toxicological exposure response relationships  with a few exceptions  as they lack the power to predict
systemic cellular effects of pharmaceuticals that underlie ADRs  Elucidating the downstream and systemic
effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis  Drugs can affect multiple proteins
and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes  Understanding this multi 
factorial physiological response using systems biology methods will ultimately aid in better predicting ADRs
before clinical trials using in vitro data  With the increasing emphasis on amassing large datasets  there is
more and more publically available knowledge on pharmaceuticals  and their effects on cells  organs  and
patients  However throughout all biomedical fields  analyzing complex datasets in a biologically coherent
fashion has been a difficult challenge  The goal of this program is to develop a predictive computational
platform analyzing gene expression data sets from drug perturbed in vitro cell lines with metabolic and protein
interaction networks for better understanding the systemic effects of over     approved pharmaceuticals with
known ADRs  The platform  named ADR Predict  will use statistical machine learning approaches to identify
network perturbation signatures that are highly predictive of specific ADRs  Developing ADR Predict has
significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry  The initial commercialization opportunity of ADR
Predict will is through service partnerships with pharmaceutical companies for accelerating and improving the
drug development pipeline by mitigating risk of clinical trial safety failures  Further  this proposal will elucidate
mechanisms of ADR pathogenesis that will be subsequently experimentally validated in Phase   Project Narrative
Adverse drug reactions  more commonly known as drug side effects  cause over        
deaths in the US annually  are responsible for      of all hospital admissions  and     of
clinical trial failures  This proposal will develop a computational platform that can both predict
drug side effects from preclinical data and elucidate associated biochemical mechanisms  The
predictive platform will accelerate pharmaceutical partnersandapos  drug development pipelines by
mitigating risk of safety failures during clinical trials of novel compounds
