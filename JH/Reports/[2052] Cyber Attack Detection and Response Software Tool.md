Cyber Attack Detection and Response Software Tool
=================================================

# Abstract


In response to the Navy’s need for a solution to provide detection and reaction to external and embedded cybersecurity attacks at the application level in real time, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop the Cyber Attack Detection and Response Software tool (CADRS). CADRS will integrate deep learning (DL) with the cyber sensors’ data to provide the tool with the artificial intelligence needed to accurately detect and react, in real time, to external and embedded cyber-attacks at the application layer in Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). In Phase I, POC will conduct research and develop technology readiness level (TRL)-4 CADRS software prototype that will be tested on an Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)-based representative system to demonstrate that CADRS identifies selected attacks and performs successfully against all developed metrics. Additionally, POC will develop a Phase II plan. In the Phase I Option period, we will refine, scale up the system design for implementation in Phase II and devise the path to transition the CADRS software to Navy use. In Phase II, POC will develop, test, and deliver prototype software that can protect application layer vulnerabilities and be integrated into a UUV and provide analysis of the test results, lessons learned, and recommendations.
