6-NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION- Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
=========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The amount of data being generated in a wide range of industries continues to grow exponentially, and yet the tools to analyze that data have not kept pace. Decision-makers need a way to derive actionable insights from these large data sets without having to commit additional human resources. infoSentience has developed a system of tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) and a Natural Language Generator (NLG) to analyze any large complicated data set, determine what events within the data are most relevant to a given end user, and then provide a natural language report on its findings. The solution is capable of generating reports ranging from a paragraph to many pages in length. These reports can include information on trends, outlier events, critical changes, and other pertinent information, all with appropriate context to help the decision-maker understand why the changes took place. infoSentience proposes to improve this system by adding two key components: (1) a web-based control panel that will give users the capability to create custom reports on demand, and (2) dynamic graphic components that will visually display key information, augmenting the written narrative.
