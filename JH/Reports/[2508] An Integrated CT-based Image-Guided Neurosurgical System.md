# Abstract


An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System
In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly-
functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally
invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact
and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard
tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high-
quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain.
Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide
updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow
optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local
image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The
project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical
removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural
network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates.
The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging
capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost.
Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has
been assembled for oversight, input and feedback.Narrative / Relevance to Public Health
Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks
and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming
and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation.
In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to
enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution
imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.
