# Abstract


Project Summary
Autism Spectrum DisorderASDis a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms
affecting repetitive behaviorsocial communicationand cognitive abilityinchildren in the
US is affected with ASDCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand the likelihood
that a child will be affected with ASD istimes higher if they have a sibling with ASDTraditionallydiagnosis occurs most frequently between agetoand severe ASD can be
diagnosed as early asmonthsThe infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention
in the first year of lifeAs suchthere exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late
to receive a more effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosisor bothThusearlier
prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomesThis
Fast Track proposal seeks to developstandardizeand commercialize software methods and
algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder predictioncreating objective biomarkers in a space
dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device
that is a singleintegratedeasy to use solution for MRI processinganalysisand syndrome
predictionTo create a Minimum Viable ProductMVPwe willpull existingacademically vetted
methods and software into a commercial design control processPhase ISAverify the
integratedfull stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database
for Autism ResearchNDARand evaluate potential sources of classification errorPhase ISAand conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedbackPhase ISAWe will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as weexpand the utility
of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sitesoptimize manual

user interface and workflowmigrate image processingmachine learningand database
infrastructure to cloud based tools that can scale on demandand iterate on the user experience
given Alpha feedbackPhase IISAevaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results
from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability
of the software in clinical settingsexpand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and
classification to include additional features and evaluate non binary feature spacesconduct latent
variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD predictionand vet the new metrics
through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release resultsPhase IIISAand develop a data report for clinical use and patient educationconduct a Beta
release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non IBIS Network siteand perform formal
software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platformPhase IIISANarrative
MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence
of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum DisorderASDThis Fast Track proposal
seeks to developstandardizeand commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD
prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infantscreating objective
biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software
as a medical device that is a singleintegratedeasy to use solution for MRI processinganalysisand prediction of syndrome developmentThis technology will provide first of its kindobjectivebrain based biomarkers that will enable development of effectiveearly interventions and improve
the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD
