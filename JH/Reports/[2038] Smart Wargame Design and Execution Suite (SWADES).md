Smart Wargame Design and Execution Suite (SWADES)
=================================================

# Abstract


Navy & Marine Corps conduct wargames to train military leaders on new tactics and to exploit new platforms and assets. However, the current approaches for wargaming life-cycle comprising design, conduct, and analysis of wargames are laborious and expensive. We will address this problem by developing SWADES, a Smart Wargame Design and Execution Suite that will automate and streamline the entire wargaming life-cycle. We will introduce capabilities for automated scenario setup, resolve player orders for immediate execution in simulation, and real-time adjudication and performance feedback to enable participants and instructors to draw valuable strategic and tactical insights over multiple excursions. We will develop and validate SWADES’ concept of operations, its software architecture, and its core automation capabilities. We build SWADES’s automation capabilities by leveraging our proven SBIR products comprising artificial intelligence techniques for automated command resolution, automated mission performance compilation from simulation logs, and model induction. We will demonstrate the feasibility of our approaches with a proof-of-concept prototype that interoperates with existing simulators. We will evaluate it on missions such as air combat, and mine countermeasures. We will work with Government stakeholders and prime partners to validate and refine SWADES CONOPS and develop a robust implementation plan for Phase II.
