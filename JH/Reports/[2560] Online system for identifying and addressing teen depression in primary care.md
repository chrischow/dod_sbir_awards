Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care
============================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits
through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The
primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with
the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as
moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused
balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a
motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing
relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas
with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP
recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always
available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping
professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental
health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These
innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of
the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and
accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by
engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement
program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of
professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system
would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the
significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this
new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for
other teen challenges might also be promising.Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the
past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive
necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen
depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time
points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new
module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.
