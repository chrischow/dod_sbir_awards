Apps for Rapid Epidemiological Analysis (AREA)
==============================================

# Abstract


Managing basis health needs in HA/DR and STTR operations is of  critical importance due to the increased risk of disease and health  crises stemming from ecological changes, population displacement,  population density changes, or the disruption of public utilities.  Despite the critical needs for rapid epidemiological surveillance,  assessment, and response in the field, very few technical aids exist  to support these efforts.  The objectives of our proposed AREA system  of handheld apps are: (1) To provide data collection that is rapid,  error free, properly directed and highly effective; (2) to provide  improved support for situational awareness, analysis and decision  making so that field users do not have to wait to analyze data and  take action; and (3) To consequently dramatically reduce delays  between data collection, analysis, decision making, and actual  disaster response.  To accomplish this, our technical approach  includes advanced in-app capabilities for data collection; machine  learning and social science based data analysis to identify health  risks, impending health crises, and to forecast disease progression;  and collaborative decision support tools for ad hoc team formation,  course of action analysis, and resource allocation.  Additionally,  accompanying visualizations help to facilitate greater situational  awareness and user comprehension.  We have a community of interested  users who are motivated to work with us in Phase II, and developed a  complete and effective strategy for rapidly transitioning the AREA  system to end users.
