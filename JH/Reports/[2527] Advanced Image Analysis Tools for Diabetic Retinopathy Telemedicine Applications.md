# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   In this small business innovations research  SBIR  project we present EyeArt  a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy  DR  screenings with high diag  nostic efficacy  With its interface to EyePACS  a license free  scalable telemedicine plat  form  EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers  Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes  Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians  lack of insurance  and lack of education  According to the Department of Health Services  DHS  in Los Angeles County  LAC  the situation for diabetics is particularly grim  with current wait times upwards of     months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening  This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss  To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population  we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening  allow reprioritizatin of ophthalmologist appointments  and aid in triage of high risk patients  Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap  proaches on large public retinal datasets  Going forward  we will build on our approach and further develop innovative  customized algorithms for critical low level image processing steps  while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision  and machine learning areas for high level  inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool  Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening  particularly benefiting under  resourced screening programs like the LAC DHS safety net and its large Hispanic diabetic population PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  EyeArt   an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy  DR  screening  while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface  This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio economic factors  To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services  LAC DHS  to deploy our system  following clinical validation  in their under resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County
