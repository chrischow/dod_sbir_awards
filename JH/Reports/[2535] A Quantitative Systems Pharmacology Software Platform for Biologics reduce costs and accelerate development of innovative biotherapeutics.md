# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    Drug development is a very lengthy and expensive undertaking  Failure rate for novel drugs exceeds      Therefore  successful drugs must cover the costs of these failures  As such  prescription drug prices have escalated at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping  The need for successful drugs to cover failures also means that pharmaceutical companies primarily devote resources to pursuing drug candidates that have a large enough population to allow the company to earn a return on its investment  Thus  diseases that affect only a small portion of the populace are not investigated nearly as much as  say  oncology  cardiovascular or immunology  Current practice usually involves taking modeling techniques developed for small molecule research and trying to adapt them to biologics  However  this approach  more often than not  does not provide the scientist with predictions around feasibility and optimal drug properties  resulting in wasted effort pursuing leads that have
no chance of making it through clinical trials  or to be reimbursed by payors  Applied BioMath has developed tools that address high value questions in the middle of the drug development pipeline  By coupling quantitative systems pharmacology techniques with high performance computing and sophisticated mathematical algorithms  we have proven an ability to predict optimal drug properties years before entering the clinic  For the past two years we have been offering our services to pharma and biotechs alike  to rave reviews  We have also been approached with inquiries to license our software  This project will fund the development of our proprietary algorithms and toolsets into a stable  standardized software platform  that can be automatically validated for GLP  for by biologics to develop their internal systems pharmacology models  At its heart  our toolsets are built on Kronecker Bio  an open source biophysical computational engine co developed by one of our Founders while pursuing his PhD in Biological Engineering with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  This robust platform is currently in use  in its raw form  in the pharmaceutical industry but is limited in its adoption due to its lack of usability  quality contro and GLP validation  This project will focus on the application and presentation layer  allowing the underlying computational functionality to be easily accessed  utilized and understood  so capital requirements are less than a typical software development project  Achieving our goal of building this software platform is only the first step  What follows is a concerted push into the biologics segment  which we are currently seeding through our services offering and gaining a reputation as a firm that delivers high value on time  We have completed our second round of fundraising  raising a total of $   m between both rounds  This grant  plus the additional fundraising  will ensure that we are able to roll out our tools and assist drug companies in delivering best in class biologics  that meet unmet medical need  on an accelerated timeline to provide patients with a better quality of life  Better  faster  cheaper drugs    truly a win win in PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   To reduce the cost of drugs  identify fast failures  and accelerate the rollout of best in class biotherapeutics  analyses in the middle of the drug development pipeline  from LI to early clinical trials  based on mechanisms and biophysics  is needed  There are currently a number of open source tools that provide systems pharmacology models for use in research  However  a lack of a standardized and automated GLP validation scheme prevents the models from continuing through to development  A robust  systems pharmacology software platform  widely utilized by drug companies and upon which fit for purpose systems pharmacology models can be built  will greatly reduce the time required to get a drug to market  enable the development of best in class drugs  increase safety for patients and significantly reduce the development costs associated with biologics  We have developed proprietary mechanistic algorithms that we currently use to analyze assays and drug program data for our customers  These algorithms are naturally grouped into certain functions toolsets  These tools are applicable  depending on what questions are being investigated  across most all therapeutics areas  While our toolsets  InVitro Analyzer  Biologic Feasibility  Biologic Optimizer 
Biologic PKPD  Biologic Mechanistic Covariants  are currently in alpha stage  being used to create fit for purpose models for our clients   they are being used in industry to fulfill our servces contracts  We are looking to create an industry standard platform  leveraging our proprietary algorithms and toolsets  that will allow drug scientists to create fit for purpose models that can be easily validated for GLP use in IND applications  We have sampled the market and estimated a potential target audience of over         users  worldwide  We arrived at this number by  reviewing the Top     Pharma companies by revenue  determining employee count from those companiesandapos  annual reports  using our Founders knowledge of select large and small pharma and biotechs and its employee count and number of employees that could use our software  segmenting the list into groups based on revenue  extrapolating on a percent basis each companyandapos s applicable target audience  assumed companies outside the Top     had one quarter       of the applicable audience as the    th largest company and then summed these estimates  This produced a number of over         potential customers  For validation  we determined that the number of people  globally  employed in the pharmaceutical industry is                  www statista com   So our target market is less than    of total pharma employees and our business model shows market penetration of just over    of our target market by       or less than       of total pharmaceutical employees
