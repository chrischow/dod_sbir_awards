Real-time Insights for Combat System Integration and Testing
============================================================

# Abstract


Numerous government agencies and commercial organizations are dependent on mission critical ecosystems (i.e. federated systems of systems [SoS]). Integration, testing, and certification (IT&C) of these ecosystems are required before fielding production ready systems. These activities are time consuming and costly, ultimately throttling the rate of improvement of these systems. Additionally, systems may pass the IT&C cycle and ultimately fail in the field. Decreasing time and cost of IT&C and increasing efficiency will be a significant enabler as federated SoS move toward rapid integration deployment and virtualization. Altron is proposing to conduct research to determine the technical feasibility of developing a software product called Unify Insight. This product will provide insight into real-time system interface and operational anomalies, and will facilitate early detection of system issues. Unify Insight will leverage the collection and aggregation of various system logs provided by UnifyRT (Real-Time), a software product developed by Altron, and establish an architecture into which future machine learning (ML) algorithms can be incorporated for continuously self-improving system analysis.
