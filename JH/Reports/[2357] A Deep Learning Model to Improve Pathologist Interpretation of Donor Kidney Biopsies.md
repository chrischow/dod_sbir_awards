A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies
====================================================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT
More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney
transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate
contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or
discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by
pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to
significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being
discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team
developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor
kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply
the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with
accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have
also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy
whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy
evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in
optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs.
The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard
for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team
of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal
will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the
automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic
damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to
withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different
laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond
the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT
Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the
kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists
is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage,
present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being
used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist
pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in
more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy
kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.
