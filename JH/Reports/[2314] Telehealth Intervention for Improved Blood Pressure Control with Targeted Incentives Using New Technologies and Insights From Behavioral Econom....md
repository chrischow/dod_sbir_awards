# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT  Hypertension  or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure  BP  of
    and    mm Hg or higher  is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U S 
The estimated prevalence is     among all U S  adults and increases with age to affect     of seniors 
Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease  global mortality  and ranks third among
the causes of disability  Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward  but patient adherence to long 
term self care strategies is problematically low  Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in
order to help lower their BP are    Taking medications as prescribed by a physician     Monitoring blood
pressure at home  and    Limiting dietary sodium intake  Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and
currently ranges from     to      the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for
these three activities with the help of new technology  In particular  this STTR will develop and test an incentive
program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens  and
precipitate reduction in BP  The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with
clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California   San Diego community  The product to be
developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones  which incorporates financial and
targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific  mental accounts  to maximize the behavioral
effectiveness of the intervention  The approach is to     Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive
strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers  support self efficacy  and complement intrinsic
motivators  and     Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state of the art telehealth
technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and
reduce BP  The telehealth innovation centers on  a  Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement
to establish behaviors   b  Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time
and effort costs of adherence  and finally  c  Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans 
providers and researchers  Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse
population within the UCSD Health system  additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes  e g  
achievement of BP andlt         mm Hg  to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood
pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives  Initial customers are health insurers and
risk bearing hospital systems  e g  those with value based reimbursement models   who are fiscally
responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure
in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals  families  and communities
across the nation  The resulting health problems  including cardiovascular disease  heart attack  stroke  and
death  and excessive spending  can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using
low cost  scalable  and widely accessible telehealth tools  such as the product of this STTR  This approach has
the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with
poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health  as
well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions
