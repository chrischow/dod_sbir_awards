Project Summary
andquot Using Meta level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia 
 Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today  It affects over     million
adult Americans each year  NIMH director Dr  Thomas Insel has declared  The best chance for preventing
serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the
disorder  at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear  However  to act before symptoms
appear requires improved predictive capacity   NIMH      Budget   Creating tools to identify high risk 
`prodromalandapos  individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to
reduce the duration of untreated psychosis  DUP   and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality
associated with schizophrenia  Recent studies have shown that over     of individuals with schizophrenia are
re hospitalized within the first    months following their initial hospitalization  Even after the first
hospitalization  preventing relapse and re hospitalization may lessen the long term severity of the illness  In
this SBIR Phase I study  we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and
individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta level
Smartphone Data  PGMSD   We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal
individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for
relapse during the critical    month period following their first episode of psychosis  FEP  
 In Phase I  we plan to recruit    individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal
clinics at Columbia  UCSD  and UCLA  where an estimated    to     of clients already own Smartphones 
Data gathered may include  the frequency of telephone calls  emails  and texts  to assess within person
changes in social connectedness  GPS  accelerometer data  to assess physical activity  isolation  and sleep
patterns  In the past  several IRB approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from
patients  Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the
meta level data into measures of social functioning  physical isolation  physical activity  and sleep wake
reversals  In addition to achieving technological success  our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our
ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls  prodromal  or
experiencing their FEP  SIPS   or          or    or    
 In Phase II  we will further develop and validate these algorithms  If successful  the Phase II project will
have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help     identify at risk individuals who `areandapos  or `are
notandapos  progressing toward conversion      serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness      give rise
to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical   
months after initial diagnosis  potentially reducing hospitalization and re hospitalization rates Project Narrative
The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals
progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re hospitalization by applying interpretive
algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta level
Smartphone Data  PGMSD  collected from the smartphones of    participants ages        If
successful  the PGMSD derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals
progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse
during the critical    month period following their first episode of psychosis  FEP   potentially
decrease hospitalization and re hospitalization rates  This passive data gathering approach will
augment existing active data collection approaches  aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting
rather than gathering data from their clients  and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting
treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of
developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondaryandapos  and eventually `primaryandapos  prevention
