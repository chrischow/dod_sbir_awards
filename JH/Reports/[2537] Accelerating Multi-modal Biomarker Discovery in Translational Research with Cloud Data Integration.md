# Abstract


Project Summary Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry datatechnologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancerThere are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single cell technologieswhere the data analysis is complexhighly expert driven and or reliant on novel computational methodologiesCytobank already makes major contributionscentralizing single cell cytometry dataproviding data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexitiesandestablishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to useHoweveras the amountcomplexityand different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single cell algorithms to analyze the data also increasesthe need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and securecomplete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and developmentThe proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platformThis will benefit the community byenabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflowsandenable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta analysis capabilities across experiments and data typesThe potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single cell cytometrytranscriptand other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert driven annotationthus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine Project Narrative Single cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trialsTo take full advantage of these revolutionsthe iteration and dissemination of advanced single cell data analysis algorithmsmany of whose development was funded by the NIHneeds to scale at the same rate as single cell data generation technologies are scalingand multi omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automatedThis project will greatly accelerate scientific researchtransparencyand reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high dimensional dataproviding the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno oncologyautoimmunity and other high impact disease areas
