Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining
========================================================

# Abstract


The goal of this proposal is to discover drug like liver X receptor  LXR    selective agonists that
can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer s disease  AD   Recent work demonstrated that
activation of the LXR signaling pathways leads to improved amyloid    A   turnover  reduction
in A  plaque area  and the reversal of cognitive  social and olfactory deficits  The research plan
consists of two steps  The first step is computer aided prediction of agonistic LXR  selective
binding  blood brain barrier permeability  and absence of side effects such as mutagenicity or
binding to undesired targets  This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by
examining the joint space of chemical compounds  targets  and chemical biological properties 
This joint space is defined using machine learning on the  D geometry of spatial arrangement of
pharmacophoric points  using attributes such as donors  acceptors  aromatic rings  and charged
fragments  The second step consists of biological assays to assess toxicity  brain penetration
potential and the ability to induce expression of the corresponding genes  A dozen diverse
compounds will have been tested through two iterations of the two steps of in silico prediction
and assays at the end of Phase    These initial leads will be augmented with additional de novo
compounds and further scrutinized via behavioral assays  dose response studies and more
detailed  sophisticated  and mechanistic assays during Phase   
The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different
stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration Interleaving of computer aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine
learning based models with biological assays will identify drug like LXR  selective agonists with
minimal side effects  These agonists will slow and reverse Alzheimer s Disease
