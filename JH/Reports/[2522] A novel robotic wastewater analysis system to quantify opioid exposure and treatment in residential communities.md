A novel robotic wastewater analysis system to quantify opioid exposure and treatment in residential communities
===============================================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
This proposed Phase I/Phase II FastTrack SBIR project will lead to the demonstration of a
robust wastewater testing and analytics platform that government stakeholders can use to guide
localized actions to respond to the opioid epidemic. The opioid epidemic is the biggest drug
crisis in American history, resulting in over 130 deaths every day. Currently, stakeholders use
overdose death data to guide their opioid response strategies. However, this data is infrequently
updated, often aggregated at geographic levels which are too large to be actionable by public
health officials, and rarely provides insight into specific drug types (e.g. prescription vs. illicit
opioids, fentanyl, etc.). Novel data sources which provide localized, real-time, and drug-specific
insights are needed to inform response efforts in this rapidly changing epidemic.
Wastewater-based testing is a promising approach for measuring population-level drug
exposure, but has significant technical limitations before it can be useful to stakeholders on the
frontlines of the epidemic. Specifically, current wastewater testing approaches rely on sampling
at wastewater treatment plants, which yields city-level data at best. This represents a
heterogenous sample and is not useful to guide localized interventions.
Biobot is the first commercial wastewater testing technology designed and built to provide
actionable public health insights for municipal stakeholders tackling the opioid epidemic. Our
robotic wastewater analysis system measures opioid exposure and treatment (distinguishing
human use from discarding in the toilet), and operates at the neighborhood-level — the
geographic resolution relevant to municipal stakeholders. The premiere version of our platform
includes (1) an algorithm to select sampling sites (manholes) that represent residential
communities in a municipality; (2) a robotic sampling device that can be installed under sewer
access portals (e.g. manhole covers) to collect 24-hour composite samples; (3) a HPLC-MS/MS
method that detects a variety of urinary metabolites of prescription opioids, methadone,
buprenorphine, and naloxone; and (4) visualization in printed reports.
The goal of this Fast Track Phase I/Phase II application is to improve our platform to make it
adoptable in cities across the nation. In collaboration with leading toxicologists at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, we will address technological gaps to improve
data reliability and move from detection to consistent quantification of opioid exposure and
treatment. In Phase I, we will improve and expand our HPLC-MS/MS method, develop
simulation models to optimize sample collection, and address the variability challenge of
24-hour sampling. In Phase II, we will develop data correction methods to enable integration
with all existing sewer infrastructures, validate our data against reported overdoses in a pilot
study across six Massachusetts municipalities, and build a data analytics and visualization
platform for our end users.
Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to an optimized and validated
wastewater testing technology that provides accurate, spatially granular, and more real-time
data on opioid exposure and treatment. In parallel with the technological development, this grant
will allow us to demonstrate the value of our product to two key customers: the City of Boston
and the State of Massachusetts. These two government organizations are key champions to
pave the way for long-term adoption by our target customers.Project Narrative
The opioid epidemic in the United States has driven the need for an innovative data solution for government
officials and policy decision-makers. This Phase I/Phase II SBIR proposal seeks to implement and
commercialize Biobot Analytics’ innovative smart sewers platform: upstream wastewater sampling technology,
validated HPLC-MS/MS analytical techniques and data analytics to provide key governmental stakeholders
with novel datasets to effectively track the abuse of opioids and other illicit drugs. Successful completion of this
project will demonstrate a robust upstream wastewater sampling strategy that can be used in separated and
combined wastewater infrastructures, and validated HPLC-MS/MS method in tandem with an interactive data
visualization dashboard, providing key decision makers with the tools they need to respond to the opioid
epidemic to decrease opioid overdoses and associated morbidity.
