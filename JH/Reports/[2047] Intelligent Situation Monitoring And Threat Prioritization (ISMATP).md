Intelligent Situation Monitoring And Threat Prioritization (ISMATP)
===================================================================

# Abstract


Currently, Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (TASW) operations are supported by manually intensive tasks carried out to integrate different sources of information and to monitor the behavior of threats in order to assess, prioritize, and respond to those threats. We propose the creation of software services for intelligent situation monitoring and threat prioritization (ISMAPTP) in order to increase officersâ€™ tactical situation awareness and reduce workload in the presence of multiple threats. ISMAPTP provides (i) a high-level event language to describe and evaluate the different spatial, temporal, and behavioral decision variables used for threat assessment and prioritization, (ii) threat intent recognition algorithms to track and interpret threat behavior, (iii) threat assessment and prioritization criteria factors for different mission and tactical contexts, and (iv) threat prioritization displays making officers aware of the more important threats and events occurring in the ASW theater. A combination of artificial intelligence techniques is used to support the proposed functionality: event correlation based on behavior transition networks, truth maintenance systems for incorporating intelligence reports, Bayesian reasoning for intent recognition, and Fuzzy Logic for defining threat prioritization criteria. ISMATP deployment will take the form of USW-DSS services supporting a Task Force commander in TASW operations.
