Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown
=========================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    RNA interference  RNAi  is a small RNA guided gene silencing process within living cells  The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest  However  one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non specific gene silencing  It is well known that  in addition to the single intended gene target  many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced  Thus  there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity  RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA  siRNA  in the silencing complex  We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design  We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely distributed commercial siRNAs  Based on this commercial success  we propose to further develop a new method for genome wide design of next generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off target effects  The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi based applications PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   RNA interference  RNAi  is a small RNA guided gene silencing process within living cells  RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence  We propose to remove a major hurdle in RNAi studies by genome wide design of siRNAs with significantly improved gene silencing specificity
