Development of a Scalable, Cloud-Based Microbiome Big Data Analytics System
===========================================================================

# Abstract


The human microbiome has emerged as a hitherto unknown causal factor in a number of disease 
ranging from cancer  cardiovascular disease  and obesity  To understand the biochemical mechanisms
of the human microbiome in these diseases  researchers must be able to store biochemical pathway 
transcriptomic  and metabolomic datasets in a coherent and compatible form  We propose to construct a
cloud based microbiome analytics platform service that provides both common data processing tools 
along with integration of a standards compliant database that can be queried to provide cross dataset
and inter modal data comparative analytics The human microbiome is the collection of bacteria that live inside of all people  and researchers have
determined that these bacteria play a causal role in many diseases such as obesity  Our proposal will
create an analysis system for processing large volumes of data from the human microbiome  allowing
efficient and easy data processing for both academic researchers and for profit biotechnology
companies
