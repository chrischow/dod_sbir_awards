# Abstract


Abstract
Assessing the effectiveness of substance abuse rehabilitation, where high relapse rates create
financial and social tolls, is a pressing clinical problem in need of better measurement tools.
The ability to identify cognitive changes should improve outcomes but current intake into
rehabilitation programs doesnâ€™t typically include cognitive tests. Simple, quick, cost-effective,
and objective measures are needed. This is the problem this proposal seeks to address.
This proposal utilizes the experience of Evolve Behavioral Health which serve 150 patients
weekly, and WAVi, a commercialized brain-assessment platform that combines EEG evoked
responses (ERP) with 5 other tests also sensitive to addiction (heart rate variability, physical
reaction times, MoCA, Trail Making, and Flanker). This user-friendly platform focuses on
minimizing testing times and cost while maximizing information. Our first premise is that
adding these tests will help us identify those addicts whose cognitive state requires modified
treatment approaches, and this will decrease relapse rates and recidivism rates.
Our second premise is that we can create a dataset that can be trained to identify appropriate
treatment regimens on an individual basis from the initial baseline test. To date, WAVi data
have shown ERP to be highly sensitive to concussion (another cognitive issue) and that
artificial intelligence on raw EEG can classify both PTSD and musculoskeletal pain with high
sensitivities and specificities.
The aims of this project are to develop a scalable EEG-based test for rehabilitation facilities
that is readily accessible to clinicians and to create a dynamic data asset to help longitudinally
predict outcomes. Accomplishing these aims will assist clinicians on the front lines of
substance abuse assessment and treatment.Narrative
This project will help create an objective and clinically accessible test to be used in
substance-abuse rehabilitation programs to assist clinicians in making intervention
choices as well as determining the timing of release from rehabilitation.
