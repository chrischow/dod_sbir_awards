Isotope Nuclear Forensics from Optical Real-time Measurements (INFORM)
======================================================================

# Abstract


Applied Spectra will fabricate a prototype field portable instrument for rapid isotopic analysis based on the demonstrated Phase I technology using an Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge (APGD) excitation/ionization source with Laser Ablation (LA) sampling and Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES). The new instrument is a paradigm shift for rapid field analysis of elements/isotopes without requiring sample preparation or consumables. The APGD was tested as an independent atomization-ionization source as well as a secondary excitation source to extend laser-induced plasma optical emission persistence. The Phase I effort showed that the APGD configured as an atomization/excitation source was the configuration of choice to provide U isotope ratios in the field with laboratory sensitivity and precision, with components that will fit in a portable (battery operated) Pelican-case footprint. Optical isotopic analysis will be measured from atomic and ionic line and molecular band emission spectra. Data analytics using chemometrics will be implemented to achieve isotopic ratio precision at sub-percent levels. The prototype portable instrument will be bench-marked against laboratory mass spectrometry measurements of U235/238 ratios using standards provided by Y12 and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
