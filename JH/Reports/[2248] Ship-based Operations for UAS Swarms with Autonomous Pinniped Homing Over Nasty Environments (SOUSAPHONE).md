Ship-based Operations for UAS Swarms with Autonomous Pinniped Homing Over Nasty Environments (SOUSAPHONE)
=========================================================================================================

# Abstract


Small Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) play a critical and growing role in government, military, commercial, and scientific operations across a range of missions such as weather monitoring, natural disaster assessment, surveillance, and infrastructure inspection. Their versatility, maneuverability, and dependability, coupled with their ability to keep operators out of harmâ€™s way, make them critical assets in a wide range of domains, but especially so in hostile, unpredictable, and dynamic environments. To operate reliably and effectively among other aircraft, replace manned aircraft missions with unmanned systems, and enable effective beyond line of sight (BLOS) operations, new capabilities are needed. Charles River proposes to develop a concept design, perform a feasibility assessment, and conduct limited risk reduction experiments for Ship-based Operations for UAS Swarms with Autonomous Pinniped Homing Over Nasty Environments (SOUSAPHONE). SOUSAPHONE is an aircraft and autopilot agnostic software framework that enables multiple ship-launched UAS to safely coordinate semi-autonomous BLOS wildlife survey operations (e.g., for pinnipeds) using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based computer vision and relative navigation techniques in challenging environments such as the Alaskan arctic.
