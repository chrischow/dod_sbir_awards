Repurposing Computational Analyses of Tactics for Training Assessments
======================================================================

# Abstract


Data generated by training exercises needs to be consolidated and processed to derive more efficient, effective and adaptive training scenarios through training objective and measures of performance analysis. The main technical challenges addressed by this solution are: data from diverse sources must be pre-processed (i.e., validated, cleaned, synchronized) and loaded into a data warehouse; the central data warehouse must have a flexible, adaptable data structure, able to ingest diverse input data streams and allow manifold analysis and processing; the solution must process this data and generate scenario recommendations; and finally the solution must ensure validity of the repurposed data assisting subject matter expertise oversight. Our solution combines proven, current and emerging technologies to provide an innovative and integrated solution for the training community. Selected technological innovations include ontology stores and graph databases (for the data warehouse) and recent artificial intelligence technologies for realizing the knowledge engine solution. Utilizing the state-of-the-art Simulation Resource Planning (SRP) Scenario & Training Management (STM) technology, we specifically address this issue, making scenario and training management, as well as big data analysis, available to the warfighter whenever and wherever needed.
