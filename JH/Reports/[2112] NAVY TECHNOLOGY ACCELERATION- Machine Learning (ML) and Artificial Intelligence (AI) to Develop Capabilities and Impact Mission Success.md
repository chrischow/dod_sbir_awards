NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION- Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
=======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


To enhance the protection of Navy operations and reinforce resilience of Navy’s supply chain, Eccalon will develop a Maritime/Nautical Cyber Secure Tool (MCST) to create highly anticipatory and responsive cyber decoys that will collect analytical data to characterize and determine the intent and capabilities of sophisticated attackers. The project will first build realistic and interactive cyber decoys to lure attackers away from high value network components that have store critical data. During the decoy’s interaction with attackers, the system will collect data on the attacker’s techniques, behavior, and target data to build a signature set used to characterize the objectives of an attack. Based on this signature set and historical data, Eccalon will use advanced analytics to characterize attack targets, the overall intention of the actors, their organization, and the level of their capabilities.
