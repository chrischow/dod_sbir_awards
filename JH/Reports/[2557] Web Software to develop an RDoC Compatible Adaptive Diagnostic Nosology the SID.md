Web Software to develop an RDoC Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology the SID
===============================================================================

# Abstract


n psychiatry  clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis  The `gold standard  for
clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM    SCID     The SCID   promotes reliability  but
its validity is questionable  There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more
homogeneous patient populations  but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in
identical twins  In the absence of symptom data  biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis 
 In a past SBIR project  TeleSage Inc  successfully converted the paper SCID into a web based
software program  The NetSCID   is now widely used in research  Nevertheless  in order to achieve the goal
of  turning clinical care networks into centers for research   Insel  Directorandapos s Blog        and furthering the
RDoC initiative  we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care  This software
must  a  require minimal clinician time   b  allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM   categories  and
 c  be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine
learning techniques  TeleSage proposes to develop a self report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both
immediate clinical needs and broader research goals  the  Screening Interview for Diagnosis  or SID 
 TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr  Michael First  the primary author of the SCID 
   iteratively developing and testing self report items  Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing 
we identified a final set of     unique self report  Likert scale items covering all of the individual sub symptoms
described within each of the SCID criteria  TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that
includes the NetSCID    IRT CAT item administration  randomization  and longitudinal reporting capabilities 
The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system 
 This Direct to Phase II application aims to create the SID  which will  a  reside on our existing secure
web PORTAL   b  administer simple Likert scale self report items   c  generate DSM   and ICD    diagnoses
for billing   d  use minimal clinician time   e  pull pre defined data fields from the EHR  e g  family history 
demographic  and biomarker data    f  be able to add new self report items for exploration   g  integrate with
machine learning tools  and  h  send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems  Because of these
features  we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers 
 The SID is intended to help transcend DSM   and to support RDoC  The SID product must be
commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research  The SID is intended to facilitate
the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker
and symptom data  a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM    SCID    represents the current diagnostic gold standard in
behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that
predominate in clinical settings  however  the full SCID   is a lengthy and complex paper and pencil instrument
that takes approximately    minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research
settings  We want to create a new  self report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper
SCID  significantly reduce diagnostic error rates  greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical
care  and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record  EHR  systems  the Screening Inventory for
Diagnosis  SID   The SID is a self report  computer adaptive diagnostic assessment  based on easy to 
understand  five point Likert scale items  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM    support RDoC  and
facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of
biomarker and symptom data
