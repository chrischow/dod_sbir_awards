Blending Classical Model-Based Target Classification and Identification Approaches with Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence
===========================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Toyon Research Corp. and the University of California propose to develop innovative algorithms to perform automatic target recognition (ATR), localization, and classification of maritime and land targets in EO/IR, LiDAR, and SAR imagery. The proposed algorithms are based on recent developments made at the University of California, which outline a strong mathematical framework for naturally blending classical model-based target recognition algorithms with modern data-driven machine-learning approaches, such as those utilizing deep learning. Specifically, this proposal presents a mathematical formalism for incorporating heuristics and feature-based detection algorithms directly into a deep neural networks (DNNs), which can be further trained and optimized for a particular ATR task specified by example or model-data. The resulting system provides a mechanism for Navy operators and DoD algorithm designers to leverage existing model-based ATR algorithms, with a known threshold of baseline-performance, to systematically design deeper and more-robust neural-network-based algorithms that can be naturally optimized and augmented using modern machine-learning approaches. Furthermore, while the proposed algorithmic framework is largely agnostic to the particular imaging-modality, we demonstrate how it can be specifically tuned to discover features that are unique to particular modalities, in either the spatial or the spatial-frequency domain, mitigating uncertainties that arise in various environmental or
