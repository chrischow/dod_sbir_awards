Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment
=====================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
This project addresses a critical need for early detection of mild cognitive impairmentMCIand other
Alzheimerandapos s related dementiasADRDAdvances in smartphone hardwarecomputer visionand machine
learning have enabled the possibility of producing smartphone based cognitive testing applications able to
collect electronic sensor data and transform it into highly informative phenotypes that can serve as early
indicators of future disease progressionIn this projectwe aim to develop a revolutionary new smartphonebased cognitive testing platformcalled CTXthat will enable the rapid development and deployment of
smartphone based tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashionsubsample and
compress the combined streamsand transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and modelingCTX will provide a high level application development framework that will significantly reduce the time and
technical knowledge required to produce a smartphone based cognitive testing application by providing an
application programming interfaceAPIthat enables developers to simply declare what sensor data should be
collected and whenThe framework will handle all the details of collecting the sensor datasynchronizing itand transmitting it to a back end serverThe API will also have a variety of other high level features to facilitate
development of cognitive test appsTo demonstrate the feasibility of our vision for CTXin Aimof this project we will develop the software
frameworkback end server software and a prototype smartphone app to exercise and validate many of the
platformandapos s featuresFor Aimwe will develop three different tests for this app to test saccadeeye movementlatencyverbal recalland wrist mobilityeach collecting a different type of sensor datavideoaudioand
inertial measurementThese tests were selected because their results have been been shown to be predictive
of MCIWe will implement phenotype extraction pipelines that employ advanced signal processingmachine
learningand computer vision algorithms to extract the target phenotypes from the sensor data collected for
these tests and demonstrate they operate with sufficient accuracy to replicate published experimental designsSuccessful completion of this project will eliminate the need for expensive and cumbersome phenotype
collection equipmente geye tracking stationsand create the possibility of generating data from which MCI
onset can be predictedData collected in Phase II via these and other such tests will enable us to apply our
machine learning expertise to produce models able to predict transition to MCI that are both sensitive and
specifictransforming any smartphone into an MCI risk assessment tool available for at home use by millions
of people Project Narrative
This NIH Phase I project will address the critical need for early detection of Alzheimerandapos s DiseaseADand
Alzheimerandapos s related dementiasADRDby developing a revolutionary new smartphone based cognitive testing
platform that will provide individuals with an ongoing status of their cognitive healthDoctors who are given
access to the results of these tests will be able to monitor patients more closely and provide more timely
diagnosesBy studying test results from many peopleresearchers may someday be able to identify patterns
that can distinguish mild cognitive impairment from normative age related cognitive decline
