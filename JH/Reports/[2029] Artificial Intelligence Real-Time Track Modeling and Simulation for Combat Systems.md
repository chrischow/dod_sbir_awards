Artificial Intelligence Real-Time Track Modeling and Simulation for Combat Systems
==================================================================================

# Abstract


Numerica proposes to develop and demonstrate JANUS, an innovative and technically-sound tool that generates track predictions in the absence of sensor observations that synergistically combines elements from physics based and artificial intelligence models. JANUS provides informed predicted track states that take into account adversarial behavior and provides associated probability metrics in real time. JANUS will have a well documented API that will allow it to not only interface with Numerica's mature track deconfliction, sensor resource management and battle management tools, but also ensure a successful transition into Aegis as well as other combat systems. Moreover, Numerica plans to transition the technology developed under this effort to existing customers in US Military and counter UAS markets. The team that Numerica has assembled includes experts in hybrid physics based and machine learning models and integrating track enhancement technologies into combat systems such as Aegis and IBCS.
