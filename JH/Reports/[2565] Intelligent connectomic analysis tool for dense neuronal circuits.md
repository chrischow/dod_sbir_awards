# Abstract


Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project SummaryThe lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseasesHigh resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structureswhich is a key to understanding the brain in health and diseaseThere is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopyEMand correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy dataThe ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disordersThis is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disordersThe reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutionsThere is a strong need for next generationwell supportedintegratedeasy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neuronstrace arbor branchesidentify synapsesspines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time consuming analyses in connectomic experimentsThere is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discoveryPowered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with DrRachel Wong andadditional labsthis project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysisICAtool optimized for dense neuronal circuitsThe tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision s flagship product Aivia toprovide accurate and automated neuron tracing inD EM andD fluorescence data up to multi terabytesidentify preand post synaptic dendrite segmentscorrelate light and electron microscopy dataquantify and classify neurons and sub cellular componentsextract and analyze neuron circuitsprovide tools for phenotype discoveriesseamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truthGTannotationeditingand machine learning workflowandaccess the required computing infrastructuredatabase connectionand exchange of data with other tools Project Narrative The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseasesThere is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopyEMand correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy dataThis is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disordersPowered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with DrRachel Wong andadditional labsthis project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysisICAtool optimized for dense neuronal circuitsThe tool will be integrated with DRVision s flagship product Aivia for commercialization
