Device for real-time streaming of preclinical research data into a central cloud-based platform
===============================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
BehaviorCloud is a unified cloud platform where biomedical researchers can collectanalyzeand share
preclinical research dataspecifically behavioral and phenotype data from animal modelsTraditionally
researchers collect data from many disparate instruments and store data on PCs running single license
softwareRaw data is stored across several locationsanalysis is restricted to the PC used to collect the dataand opportunities for collaborationremote participationand data sharing are limitedBehaviorCloud is
leveraging cloud data streaming and storage to overcome these barriers to discoveryInBehaviorCloud
released a first version of the underlying cloud platform as well as BehaviorCloud Cameraan open sourcereference implementationthat demonstrates automated video tracking of animal behavior on the
BehaviorCloud platform using a consumer grade smartphoneThis tool and the underlying platform are both in
active use across academic and pharmaceutical labsThe aim of this Phase I SBIR application is to develop
patent pendingBridgetechnology that allows data streaming from third party instrumentation into the central
web platformResearchers will bypass the original software and PCs associated with their instruments to
control trials through their BehaviorCloud account and receive data back in real timeBehaviorCloud will
provide a public repository to aggregate all of these data and accelerate discovery by providing computational
tools for large scale meta analysis and machine learning based predictive analytics Project Narrative
BehaviorCloud is a unified cloud platform where biomedical researchers can collectanalyzeand share
preclinical research dataspecifically behavioral and phenotype data from animal modelsThe goal of this
Phase I SBIR application is to develop the technology to enable streaming of data from all kinds of behavioral
and phenotyping instrumentation into the BehaviorCloud platformBehaviorCloud will aggregate these data
into a repository and accelerate discovery by providing tools for collaboration and meta analysis
