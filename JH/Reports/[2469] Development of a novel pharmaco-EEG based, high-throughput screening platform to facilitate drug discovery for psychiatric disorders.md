Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders
====================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY
The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of
action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders.
One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and
side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in
clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical
drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal
to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective
measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct
validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG
fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and
can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to
rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable
information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly
available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric
disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in
performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning
approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or
underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown
compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG)
database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier
using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based
drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their
EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test
our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters
of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCubeÂ® database of same
compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even
greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG
signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential
therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG.PROJECT NARRATIVE
There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate
of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans,
PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict
therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages
of drug development.
