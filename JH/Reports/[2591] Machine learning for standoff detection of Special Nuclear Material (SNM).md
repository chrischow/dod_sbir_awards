Machine learning for standoff detection of Special Nuclear Material (SNM)
=========================================================================

# Abstract


"Deep Learning for standoff detection of Special Nuclear Material (DLeN) applies the same deep learning techniques that allow computers to beat human performance in image recognition and the game of Go to detecting Special Nuclear Material. Spectral analysis and signal processing can in some cases be augmented by the use of much larger neural nets that conduct much deeper analysis of features of the sensor data. This may enable the extraction of information indicating presence of SNM from a standoff distance and with a shorter amount of time. Training a deep neural net is very computationally intensive and requires specialized hardware. Execution is very computationally inexpensive and can easily happen in JVM even with very modest CPU and memory.  Phase 1 of the project determines feasibility by training a deep neural net to analyze sensor data. The success metrics are the false negative and false positive rates."
