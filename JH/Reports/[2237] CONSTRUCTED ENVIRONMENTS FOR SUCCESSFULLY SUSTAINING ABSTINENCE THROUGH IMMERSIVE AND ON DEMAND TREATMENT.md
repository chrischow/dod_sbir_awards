=========================================================================================================

# Abstract


Charles River Analytics and our partners at Massachusetts General Hospital and Virtual Reality Medical Center propose to design and demonstrate Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On Demand Treatment  CESSATION   We will build VR environments using our in house game engine and content  cues  that are diverse  realistic  and well placed  bolstering traditional psychological therapy delivery  and use research based principles of narrative and game design to produce immersive and engaging content to motivate continued use  We will use probabilistic models  e g   Bayesian networks  and machine learning  e g   neural nets  to learn from patient data and clinician input to assist in selecting and combining therapies in a way that is tailored to the individual patient  Finally  CESSATION will communicate information to clinicians in a manner that is understandable  and gives them enough meta information to foster appropriate trust in the system  The anticipated results of the proposed Phase I work are      an initial domain analysis      initial VR content      initial motivational content      prototype sensor capabilities      a prototype Intervention Tailoring Component      a prototype Clinician User Interface and Remote Patient Data Server  and     an initial Phase I CESSATION prototype demonstration and evaluation
