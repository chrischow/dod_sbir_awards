# Abstract


The purpose of this research is to investigate the implications of culture for interagency SSTR operations and to outline the design requirements for a computer-based operational support and performance development system. The overall goal is to determine how to leverage advanced technologies in order to create an augmented performance environment, thereby enhancing interagency interaction in all phases of SSTR operations. In Phase I, the research necessary to design the augmented performance environment was conducted. Common cultural clashes arising during interagency SSTR planning were identified and linked to collective performance deficits. General expert strategies for handling cultural dissonance also were identified. A distributed planning environment augmented by artificial intelligence was designed in order to enable interagency players to adopt expert strategies for success and reduce incidents of collective performance deficits. A prototype version of this augmented performance environment was developed and its feasibility evaluated. Phase II effort will be devoted to extending the prototype capability to fully enable the adoption of expert strategies for success. Extended capabilities will better enable system users to set the conditions for successful interagency SSTR planning and to solve cross-cultural communication problems in real time. Phase II also will include a comprehensive test and evaluation.
