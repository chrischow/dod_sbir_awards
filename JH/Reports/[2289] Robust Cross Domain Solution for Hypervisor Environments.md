Robust Cross Domain Solution for Hypervisor Environments
========================================================

# Abstract


Luna Innovations research engineers will work as a part of the Navy Research Laboratory hypervisor agile development team to develop a system that applies artificial intelligence (AI) along with static checking to provide assured sanitization in a Cross-Domain Solution (CDS).  The proposed design will implement a symphony of AI techniques, led by an agent / machine learning shadow that parallels each user as they work and conducts the transition of data between domains.  Above the user/desktop level, yet still utilizing desktop processor resources across a monitoring network, will be distributed trend analysis and other AIs for analyzing the activities of social networks of users.  Automated CAO intervention requests will be made for unresolvable data.  Transfer will be tabled pending review.  We will develop a policy tool to enable broad adoption across agencies with different security policies.  The focus of the effort will be on realizing a high level of assurance for information passing between security levels, realizing accountability, and providing a high resolution enterprise-wide data emissions profile, while being as unobtrusive as possible.  Essentially, we will provide a controlled environment in which we can trust authorized users to decide which data to transition and yet monitor them for malicious behavior.
