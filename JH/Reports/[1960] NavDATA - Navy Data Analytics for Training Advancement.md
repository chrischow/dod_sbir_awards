NavDATA: Navy Data Analytics for Training Advancement
=====================================================

# Abstract


The Navy recognizes the potential for big data to facilitate readiness. Big data analytics present numerous challenges, (1) exacerbated primarily by the evolving nature of Navy tactics. (2) Further, the Navy is not one domain, but many interdependent platforms; each of which must be served by these analytics. (3) Finally, presenting these data effectively to facilitate action presents a third challenge. Aptima recognizes these challenges as a significant opportunity to establish a quantitative training pipeline for selected platforms. The Navy Data Analytics for Training Advancement (NavDATA) is a big data analytics solution that utilizes training and qualifications data to discover training opportunities that will enhance force proficiency. NavDATA uses a unique understanding of the relationships between performance measures and assessments to maintain relevance in a changing tactical environment. A supervised machine learner and Bayesian statistics will use these relationships to detect and respond to changing tactical behaviors (challenge 1). These processes are adaptable to changing data, enabling them to scale from one platform to many offering a fleet and ultimately service-wide solution (challenge 2). Advanced data visualizations offer salient representations of analytical results that will make training interventions identifiable and prompt key decision makers to initiate these.
