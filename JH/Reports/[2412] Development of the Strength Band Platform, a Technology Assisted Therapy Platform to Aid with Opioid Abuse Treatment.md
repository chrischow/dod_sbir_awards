Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.
=====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130
Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which
effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing
mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial
phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of
mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for
effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most
commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively
assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array
and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will
provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world
settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the
outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially
available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists
of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically
validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction
algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance
and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated
into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which
will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on
developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to
demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage
extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate
performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of
relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions.PROJECT NARRATIVE
To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use
and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable
device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths
and relapses.
