Artificial Intelligence Real-Time Track Modeling and Simulation for Combat Systems
==================================================================================

# Abstract


The growing proliferation of unmanned air and surface vehicles poses a potential tactical threat to current naval platforms. This threat continues to grow as the technology needed to develop such vehicles in vast numbers becomes easier for both state and non-state actors. The subsequent increase in the number of potential air and surface targets tracked and engaged in a tactical environment, where both communications and sensor data acquisition may be hampered by enemy activity, is of critical concern. The objective of this effort is to develop a mechanism that will provide the AEGIS (and potentially the Future Surface Combatant (FSC)) combat system with real-time M&S-based tracking updates to “fill in the gaps” when operating in a communication and/or sensor challenged environment is needed.
