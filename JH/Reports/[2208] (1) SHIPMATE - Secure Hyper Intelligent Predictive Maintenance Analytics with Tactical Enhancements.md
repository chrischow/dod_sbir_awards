(1) SHIPMATE: Secure Hyper Intelligent Predictive Maintenance Analytics with Tactical Enhancements
==================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Navy’s ability to collect, store, and curate raw maintenance and inventory data continues to exceed its ability to effectively process it.  Given the Navy's stakeholder-identified challenge to improve condition-based maintenance (CBM) with machinery monitoring and prognostics to maximize endurance and operational availability, and therefore readiness of Navy systems, Colvin Run Networks Inc. (Colvin Run) proposes a study of Navy-oriented machine-learning-enabled Predictive Maintenance And Inventory Management (PMIM) enhancement solution for CBM, SHIPMATE: Secure Hyper Intelligent Predictive Maintenance Analytics with Tactical Enhancements.
