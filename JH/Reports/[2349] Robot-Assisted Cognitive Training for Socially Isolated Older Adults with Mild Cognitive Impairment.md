# Abstract


Project Summary Abstract
This project will develop a Socially Assistive RobotSARto provide cognitive trainingin the form of learning
to play the pianoto improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially isolated older
adultsThe SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks
designed to reflect particular cognitive functionsmemoryattentionlanguageand social acuityThe goals of
this project are that the SAR willengage the persons with mild cognitive impairmentPMCIin skill building
