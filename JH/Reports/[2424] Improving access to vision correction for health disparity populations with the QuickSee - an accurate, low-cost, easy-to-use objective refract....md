Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor
================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Summary
The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low cost autorefraction
device called the QuickSeein order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populationsPoor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low resource settings throughout the world and
significantly reduces quality of lifeeducationand productivityThe existing QuickSee only extracts the lowerorder aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eyeto roughly estimate an eyeglass
prescriptionThis proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the
lowerand higher order aberrations contained within the complete wavefrontTo realize this goalwe will
enrollsubjectseyesin BaltimoreMDand will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuityVAmeasurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the
wavefront to refraction algorithm of the QuickSee deviceThe main output of this project will be a robust
and improved accuracy next generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease
the training requirements of eye care professionalsand potentially dispense refractive correction that
provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professionalSuccessful completion of this
work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity
populations in the USA and internationally in low resource settingsUpon completion of this proposalwe will
apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread
deployment of the next generation QuickSee with minimally trained personnel in order to accurately and
reliably provide thousands of pairs of low cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities Project Narrative
This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of
refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low resource settingsSpecificallysophisticated
algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the
efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionalsand potentially provide refractive
correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professionalOur goal is to develop a lowcosteasy to usescalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally
