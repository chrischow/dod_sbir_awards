The Impact Integrated Data System for Quality and Outcomes Tracking of Prevention Programs
==========================================================================================

# Abstract


There has been substantial progress in developing evidence based prevention programs  EBPPs  for preventing risky behaviors and promoting positive outcomes for youth  Unfortunately  their adoption  quality implementation  long term sustainability  and scalability in real world service settings continues to lag far behind  resulting in an inability to achieve the intended broad scale public impact  This SBIR Fast Track project will address a key implementation barrier to broad scale adoption and sustained use of EBPPs the need for ongoing tracking and documentation of how  process data  and to what extent  outcomes data  an EBPP results in intended youth outcomes under real world conditions  Building on the existing collaboration between  C Institute and Penn State University Prevention Research Centerandapos s EPISCenter  we will develop Impact  an easy to use  cost  and time efficient technology platform to gather relevant process and outcome data and produce meaningful real time reports at provider  service setting  and state wide levels  The proposed project will accomplish five specific aims  Phase I      Create a fully functional prototype based on feedback gathered from providers and administrators during prior research by  C and EPISCenter  Previously developed wireframes will be made fully functional and a complete system blueprint will be developed for five of EPISCenterandapos s supported EBPPs      Conduct a feasibility test with providers and agency state administrators currently implementing one or more EBPPs supported by EPISCenter  Phase II      Develop the full product with stakeholders  including all proposed Impact functionality for five EPISCenter supported EBPPs  through an iterative development testing revision process to ensure the software achieves optimal usability for intended end users      Conduct a field study with EBPP providers to assess the feasibility  usability  and value of process and outcomes tracking  Providers will be assigned to one of two conditions   a  using EPISCenterandapos s current methods  Excel spreadsheet andamp  asynchronous reporting  and then  b  using Impact  We expect Impact will result in significant improvements in all areas      Prepare Impact for commercialization by conducting focus groups with EBPP providers and administrators to review pilot test results and gather stakeholder feedback to finalize the complete product  Preparation for Phase III commercial launch will also include development of all needed demos  training materials  and resources for end users and integration of e commerce functions into the website  Impactandapos s technology infrastructure will be able to accommodate a wide array of EBPPs  providing a much needed cost effective mechanism to support broad scale dissemination and use in service settings  In addition  administrators will be able to track implementation  thus enhancing accountability and providing on going quality assurance  while also providing data analytics to quickly and effectively monitor impact and cost effectiveness  thereby increasing the likelihood a programandapos s core features are adhered to over time and maximizing treatment benefits for youth Estimated national expenditures for treatment of mental health and substance abuse disorders in      alone were $    billion  Over six million young people receive treatment for mental  emotional  or behavioral problems each year  however  only     of youth between ages      who need mental health services receive those services  Without preventive efforts  behavioral health problems will have long term effects on life  course outcomes and public expenditures for housing  education  employment  disability  income support  criminal justice  and other social welfare services  As much as $  trillion could be saved each year simply by investing in prevention efforts  Wide scale implementation of evidence based prevention is critical to reining in the escalating costs of healthcare  Scaling proven prevention approaches can improve health and well being  reduce the economic burden of preventable disease  and promote health equity The proposed Impact software package will provide an easy to use  cost  and time efficient technology platform capable of supporting a wide array of EBPPs by feasibly gathering relevant process and outcome data  producing real time analytics and meaningful reports  at provider  service setting  and state wide levels   and linking data analytics to continuous quality improvement  CQI  feedback for providers
