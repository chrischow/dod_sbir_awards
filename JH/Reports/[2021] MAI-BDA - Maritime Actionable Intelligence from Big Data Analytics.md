MAI-BDA: Maritime Actionable Intelligence from Big Data Analytics
=================================================================

# Abstract


The Navy seeks big data technology to enhance decision-making during maritime missions. The success of military operations significantly depends on the level of situational awareness. For the P-8A Poseidon conducting long-range anti-submarine warfare and other mission areas, there is an exponentially increasing array of sensors and disparate information sources for inflight sensor operators to analyze. The sheer volume and variety of data is flooding operators and potentially causing operator fatigue from data overload. The proposed Maritime Actionable Intelligence from Big Data Analytics (MAI-BDA) system will allow the operator to process and analyze terabytes of data per mission and across missions. The actionable intelligence provided by the operator enables the aviator to rapidly make informed decisions and respond more quickly to ever changing events. MAI-DBA is able to automatically process data such as but not limited to: imagery, acoustic, environmental, intelligence, and historical habit patterns. The analytic suite developed for MAI-BDA allows an operator to uncover hidden and unknown correlations to help predict target actions.
