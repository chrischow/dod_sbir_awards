Intelligent Assistant For Just Enough Data Sharing Across Multiple Security Domains
===================================================================================

# Abstract


The ability to identify and share information in a "just enough" manner is critical in defense, intelligence, and industry settings. Human analysts in both government and private sectors are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data, compounded by the increasing complexity of information sharing policies. Unlike companies that provide infrastructure and platforms for information sharing, such as guards and servers, Enkia will provide software to analyze the content of what is being shared across such platforms. Using advanced artificial intelligence technologies, Enkia will be the first to offer adaptive products that can learn to identify sensitive and critical information without extensive hand-coding of information sharing policies.  Our key insight is to leverage the same sheer volume of data that is overwhelming human analysts and use it to feed a data-hungry AI engine capable of learning from that data. Our technologies include natural language processing to analyze semantic content, case-based reasoning for document classification, and relevance feedback for automatic self-learning. This innovative combination of technologies will be deployed through a state-of-the-art service-oriented architecture, enabling usage via desktop plug-ins, server-based filters, and web service applications.
