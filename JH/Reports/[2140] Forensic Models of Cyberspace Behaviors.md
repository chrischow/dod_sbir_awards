Forensic Models of Cyberspace Behaviors
=======================================

# Abstract


Our solution will provide an automated system driven by advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to capture network traffic (including potential malicious events), perform forensic analysis of the events to identify threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), create a database of classified events and TTPs (threat models) from which connections can be made between events, actors, and organizations, then feed these identified TTPs and connections to actors into realtime IDS systems to predict future malicious events from identified actors.
