Rapid Automated Data Ingestion for Universal Search (RADIUS)
============================================================

# Abstract


Maintaining maritime supremacy requires providing Commanders the right information at the right time to make the best possible decision given the current conditions and mission. Great strides have been made to improve access to the myriad of Department of Defense enterprise and open source, publicly available data sources. Unfortunately, while access to data has been significantly improved, the technology required to aggregate, fuse, and exploit these data sources has not kept up. To resolve this issue, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation proposes the Rapid Automated Data Ingestion for Universal Search (RADIUS) system to enable the inclusion of new data sources and maintaining support for changing data sources as required to fulfill the Navy intelligence mission. The RADIUS system will utilize recent advancements in machine learning to achieve the overall goals of the proposed effort including automatically adapting to new and modified data sources; handling the necessary volume, variety, variability, velocity, and veracity of data; and providing a consistent global intelligence picture. The system will blend both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to provide a solution robust to the dynamic ingest environment, while minimizing manual work.
