Autonomous Non-Destructive Inspection
=====================================

# Abstract


We offer a framework that will provide flexible automatic programming of robots and a vision system used for matching unknown structural components to known structural components with a machine learning engine and a training library of the types of components which will be encountered. Our library includes a parameterized scan path for each component and the inspection technique we used (Eddy Current, Through-Surface Transmission, Thermography, etc.) When an unknown component is encountered, we extract the relevant features from its CAD model (bounding box size, surface area, orientation, curvature, etc.) Â and use machine learning to match it against our library of known components to find the probability of a match. Our library of parts is selected as the representative components of those we will encounter, and the scan paths are taught by an experienced NDI programmer using our industry hardened E-HUB NDI software. This information is stored in a format that will make machine learning matching viable.
