An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic
======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT
More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These
degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as
optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and
management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to
the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial
intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new
demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately,
current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in
ophthalmology,
Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create
an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend
the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin
(MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications
in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with
traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578
fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE
to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including
the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud)
REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c)
Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate
and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational
Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster,
with less frustration, and greater confidence.
Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While
the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical
endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of
image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic.Project Narrative
With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or
glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests
of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access
and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated
platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data. If we meet our
objectives, our platform will reduce the cost of clinical research and increase the speed of translating critical
research insights to saving the sight of millions of patients.
