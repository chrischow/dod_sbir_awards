FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing
========================================================================================

# Abstract


The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic
bacterial strains of SeLux s rapidlow costphenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testASTsystemfast AST or FASTUtilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried
antibiotic microplatesand avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probesFAST will potentially transform
therapy of infections by significantly accelerating ASTthereby facilitating treatment with the
optimal antibioticAimwill apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strainswhile developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utilityAimwill extend the
FAST platform to slow growing strains and species as wellSeLux has demonstrated FAST to
exceed FDAkrequirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations forstrains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panelsCompletion of
the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically relevantnon fastidious bacterial
pathogensSeLux s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensingmicrobiologyand
algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical MicrobiologyInfectious
Diseaseand Machine Learning The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value based healthcarewhich requires rapid and
accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatmentNowhere is this more important than in
treating infectionswhere doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad spectrum
antibiotics during an agonizinghour wait for antibiotic susceptibility testASTresultsThe
novelrapidlow cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in
treatment by as much ashoursThis advance would be transformative for the treatment of
infections because current over use of broad spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual
patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance
