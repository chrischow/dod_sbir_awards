Cyber Adversary Discovery Engine (CADE)
=======================================

# Abstract


We propose to design and build the Cyber Adversary Discovery Engine (CADE) for forensic cyber analysis. CADE combines expressive behavioral modeling technology with machine learning to automatically recognize adversary behaviors, goals and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). CADE can further automatically recognize changes in adversary TTPs that occur in forensic data. A key technical capability of CADE in addition to its automatic detection capabilities, is its ability to work as an intelligent collaborator with analysts performing forensic cyber analysis, allowing deeper insights and wider analysis than would otherwise be possible.
