(6) Applying AI/ML Methods to Streamline Software Development
=============================================================

# Abstract


Navy seeks to incorporate AI/ML to offload tedious cognitive or physical tasks. Our innovation is self-coding software that reacts to business changes as they happen at low effort and cost. It enables code reuse across the enterprise by referencing code from a common database, so any change can be immediately applied across all applications where it is used. We propose combining tools and techniques currently in use and creating a machine learning foundation that applies algorithms to generate a significant proportion of the code, as well as algorithms aimed at security, usage, and numerous other currently manual efforts. Since developers need to produce less code to generate working software, systems can be developed more quickly, maintained more easily, and are less expensive. Data gathered on applications constructed with the tool and data points collected from legacy applications are stored and updated in real-time. This provides insight into all software projects from a central console / dashboard. From the centralized management portal, itâ€™s possible to push updates to multiple projects simultaneously.
