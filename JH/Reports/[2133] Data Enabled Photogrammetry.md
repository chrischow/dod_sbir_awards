# Abstract


Virtualitics is an advanced data analytics and visualization company that merges AI and VR to empower users to quickly find insights in complex data. Our commercial solution, VIP - Virtualitics Immersive Platform®, is an AI-driven data analytics and advanced visualization software product that empowers users, regardless of their background, to quickly find insights from complex multisource data. The embedded AI guides the user in rapidly finding insights in complex data and suggests ways to visualize those insights for optimal human understanding. Our patented technology for 3D visualization enables the user to intuitively visualize the insights in multiple dimensions at the same time (x, y, z, color, size, etc.) and geospatially. The optional VR component also allows the user to effectively communicate those insights to others through our SVO - Shared Virtual Office™ where all parties involved can interact with the data. The data visualizations and collaboration tools available in VR are also available as 3D visualizations on laptops or desktop terminals. The technical objective of this Phase II is to extend machine learning data analytic layers directly onto photogrammetry models in desktop 3D and VR. The initial military use-case under consideration is to improve RF signature mission planning and analysis through the combination of 3D geo-rectified satellite imagery and data analytic overlays of signal propagation patterns to enable Electronic Warfare Support Team and Signal Management workflows. The goal is to achieve more effective and realistic mission planning, execution, and training by creating the ability to conduct advanced analysis in desktop and also in a collaborative, immersive Virtual Reality environment.
