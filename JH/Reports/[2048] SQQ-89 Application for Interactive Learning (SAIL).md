SQQ-89 Application for Interactive Learning (SAIL)
==================================================

# Abstract


CTI will develop a concept for a multiplayer serious game to maintain and enhance AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 (“SQQ-89 ") operator skills., establishing feasibility through modeling and analysis of the game design. In this multiplayer game, up to four “non-player characters” (NPCs), human roles filled by artificial intelligence (AI)-powered autonomous agents, will complete the SQQ-89 crew complement when all crew members are not available for game play. Among the most challenging aspects of the project are the requirements to assess player performance granular after-action reviews (AARs) while supplying the AI for NPCs. CTI will leverage Phase II SBIR work (topic N171-035) developing a “gamification” capability for the SQQ-89 system itself. The current project employs advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and technology to build expert models: an automated capability to show what “right” looks like. CTI’s current SQQ-89 effort includes the development of a composable, virtual, marine environment called the Just Add Water Simulation (JAWS). SAIL users will have an a priori grasp of maritime sound propagation and sonar principles in general and SQQ-89 in particular. SAIL will not be a training aid for the sonar novice, but rather a skills and knowledge component refinement tool for operators of varying experience and skill.
