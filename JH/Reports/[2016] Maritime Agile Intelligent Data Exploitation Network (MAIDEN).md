Maritime Agile Intelligent Data Exploitation Network (MAIDEN)
=============================================================

# Abstract


Colvin Run Networks, LLC presents the Maritime Agile Intelligent Data Exploitation Network (MAIDEN), extending and integrating leading commercial off-the-shelf and open source analytical tools to support mission objectives with enhanced situational awareness. MAIDEN is built on a scalable and highly flexible analytics architecture supplemented with proven iterative data mining techniques to unlock the potential from large volumes of disparate data. The Phase I project will demonstrate Big Data analysis methods leveraging modern cross-source data techniques, including those pioneered in socio-technological network science, and the latest data visualization and predictive analytics best practices with a sustainable data management strategy. MAIDEN enables (1) cross-source correlations and searches using a single query across databases, (2) machine learning-enhanced target resolution and disambiguation, (3) a scalable virtualization infrastructure, (4) rapid automated multi-source data processing, and (5) tailored visualization tools to aid analysts in determining target patterns of life while highlighting anomalies across available information sources. Implementing MAIDEN will enable mission commanders to exploit more of the existing P-8A information to make real-time and informed decisions in a maritime operational environment.
