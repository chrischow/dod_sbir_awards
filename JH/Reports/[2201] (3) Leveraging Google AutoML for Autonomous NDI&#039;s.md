(3) Leveraging Google AutoML for Autonomous NDI&#039;s
======================================================

# Abstract


Simple Technology Solutions (STS) proposes leveraging Google Cloud Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) to conduct autonomous NDI’s to determine or validate if pitting or uniform attack corrosion exists, and therefore if maintenance or repairs are needed. We will use Google AutoML and publicly available datasets of damaged and undamaged platforms to create and train a model that recognizes pitting and attack corrosion. We will then apply the model to high resolution RGB images gathered via American drone services, and iteratively  test and re-train the model to achieve the highest possible accuracy measurement. Our hypothesis is that if you train Google AutoML to identify and flag uniform attack corrosion and pitting in aerial images (thereby prioritizing maintenance and repair needs), you can remove labor from external surface inspections in terms of both total hours and necessary on-site expertise.
