ADVISE: Advanced Prognostics System
===================================

# Abstract


The Electrostatically Supported Gyro Navigator (ESGN) is a critical subsystem of SSBNs. At present, troubleshooting the complex ESGN system involves the system throwing alert codes and fault codes to the user and the user having to go through the IETM procedures resulting in multiple manual diagnostic tests and unnecessary parts replacement. All of this can be avoided if the likelihood of part failure is known a priori based on real-time data from the ESGN. As US Navy prepares the new Increment 8 (Inc 8) Inertial Navigation System (ESGN-R) for deployment, it is the perfect time to focus on taking ESGN-Râ€™s maintainability to the next level. Thus, an opportunity presents itself for Intelligent Automation Inc. in collaboration with Boeing Company to propose the development of ADVISE, an Advanced Prognostics System for Inc 8 INS. ADVISE will be a smart prognostics tool using machine learning techniques to examine large sets of diverse data from the INS and associate trends or other changes in particular elements with poor or deteriorating performance in the system. Such associated trends will present an opportunity for crews or second-level personnel to take preventive or corrective actions before anomalous conditions cause complete system failures during a patrol.
