# Abstract


Electronic warfare (EW) is any action involving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum to control the spectrum, attack an enemy, or impede enemy assaults. In EW, emitter identification is a necessary requirement to apply countermeasures against threat emitters. Electronic support measure (ESM) receivers play an important role by intercepting signals and measuring their physical parameters. The received signals usually consist of sequences of pulses emitted from multiple radar transmitters. However, in many cases, ESM receivers are unable to recognize the different emitters of the same type or class. Especially in modern radar systems, it becomes a challenging task to classify emitters that can operate in multiple bands.Nokomis proposes a signal transmitting and receiving scheme based on non-periodic signals associated with wavelet based signal detection/identification and classification. During the Phase I effort, Nokomis will develop unique transmitting signal waveforms using Nokomis in-house RF equipment, and detection and identification methodology on receiving site based on wavelet processing in cooperated with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) technique. In addition, Nokomis will produce representative non-periodic transmitting signal waveforms using Nokomis in-house RF equipment apparatus, and identification and classification methodology on receiver site based on wavelet processing in cooperated with AI/ML technique.
