# Abstract


THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEM (KBES) FOR AIR FORCE&apos;S COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS (C3) SYSTEMS REQUIRES THE COOPERATIVE INTERACTION OF DISTRIBUTED COMMUNITIES OF EXPERT SYSTEMS SUPPORTING BOTH TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC MILITARY OPERATIONS. THIS PROPOSED STUDY WILL ADDRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATED TARGET TRACKING AND IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT CAN INCREASE AUTOMATION IN THE FORM OF INNOVATIVE SIGNAL PROCESSING, SENSOR DATA FUSION AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO REDUCE A BATTLE COMMANDER&apos;S WORKLOAD AND TO ENHANCE THE TOTAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. THIS RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES, IMPROVE TECHNIQUES FOR DEVELOPING KNOWLEDGE BASES, AND IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE METHODOLOGIES FOR DEVELOPING THE C3 KBES. THE STUDY WILL ALSO RECOMPASS HIGH SPEED DATABASE SEARCH TECHNIQUES, SELF-LEARNING AND INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT, IMPROVED MAN-MACHINE INTERFACES, AND TECHNIQUES FOR REASONING FROM EVIDENCE THAT MAY BE INACCURATE, INCOMPLETE, INCORRECT AND TIME-VARIANT. ENHANCED INFERENCE ENGINE ARCHITECTURE AND EXPLANATION CAPABILITIES OF THE C3 KBES WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED.
