A Biopsychosocial Approach To Real-Time Health Monitoring For Performance Optimization Of Isr Operators
=======================================================================================================

# Abstract


Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) workflows do not effectively or comprehensively consider the potentially negative impacts of physical and cognitive degradation on human analysts performance. This is particularly true when analysts experience negative effects from fatigue or burnout, which they are unlikely to self-report. Occupational stress can impact quality-of- life, physiological function, and is associated with alteration in performance. S.A.Wyze has developed a biosensor platform that is well-suited to achieving this goal. S.A.Wyze will develop a specific product form that uses a Biopsychosocial Approach to Real-Time Health Monitoring for early detection of physical and cognitive degradation in ISR operators. This secured solution will utilize novel integrated technologies to create a holistic, personalized profile that includes physiological data from novel on-body biosensors,environmental and psychological data from mobile application inputs, social behavior data from social media accounts that feeds into cloud-based artificial intelligence engine.
