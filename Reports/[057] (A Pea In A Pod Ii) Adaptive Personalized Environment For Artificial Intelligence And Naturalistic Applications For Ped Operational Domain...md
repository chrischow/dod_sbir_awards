(A Pea In A Pod Ii) Adaptive Personalized Environment For Artificial Intelligence And Naturalistic Applications For Ped Operational Domain
==========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Analysts within the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) community have a challenging role, one that requires the ability to navigate and interpret mounds of data to produce responsive products during Phase 1 processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED). New tools and information displays continue to increase the complexity of the analysts workspace without established human-machine interface or interaction guidelines for sustained usability and naturalistic system interaction. An innovative and engaging human-machine interface/interaction (HMI) framework that takes advantage of emerging ubiquitous interaction technologies and paradigms is needed. To address this challenge, the Aptima team developed the Adaptive Personalized Environment for Artificial Intelligence and Naturalistic Applications for PED Operational Domain (A PEA IN A POD). The objective of A PEA IN A POD is to design and develop advanced multimodal human-machine interfaces and interactions for full-motion video (FMV) data analysis PED to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of product creation, information management, and interaction between analysts. The analysts user interface provided by A PEA IN A POD is driven by integrated context-based reasoning to enable proactive support of the analysts and form connections of information across data sources.
