Automated Pallet Planning
=========================

# Abstract


The Air Mobility Command (AMC) is responsible for shipping approved air cargo anywhere in the world at a moments notice to support warfighter requirements. In order to meet this need, airmen must be able to rapidly, effectively, and efficiently palletize cargo, frequently on 463L pallets, to prepare them for shipping. However, due to the configuration needs, weight difference, and varying sizes, the selection and assembly process to construct these pallets is time-consuming and inefficient. To additionally complicate matters, much of the cargo to be transported typically is composed of non-standard packages which are individually picked and assembled onto pallets. There is a need for an Automated Pallet Planner (APP) tool that can automatically create a loading plan for how to load cargo onto pallets to be loaded onto an aircraft. Cybernet proposes to build an APP that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) concepts to analyze the cargo to be shipped and then creates a pallet loading plan. The loading of different items onto a single pallet is an example of the Multiple Bin Size Packing Problem (MBSPP) and the Multiple Heterogeneous Knapsack Problem (MHKP) for which there are a number of known solutions, despite the problem spaces being NP-Hard problems.
