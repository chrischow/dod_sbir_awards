=====================================================================================

# Abstract


In today&apos;s complex, multi-dimensional, coalition, effects-based campaigns; commanders must be able to &quot;see&quot; the situation in their decision making tasks. The modern fighting force is privy to an enormous array of intelligence gathering, database, and sensor sources of information to the point of over-saturation. Methods for visualizing the information in an intuitive manner must be established for the sake of our forces. The information must be presented in such a way that human attention is captured and maintained on the most critical aspects of the information. The visualization will need to adapt to the changing circumstances and show the most relevant information. The team of 21st Century systems, Incorporated and Wright State University is pleased to propose the development of a tool that will provide the visualization capability and decision support necessary to make the warfighters&apos; use of information second to none.  We call our concept Holistic Analysis, Visualization, &amp; Characterization Assessment Tool (HAVCAT). We will be leveraging existing work in visualization techniques combined with cutting edge research into artificial reasoning and decision under uncertainty to design the data structures and architecture to dynamically adjust visualizations while remaining cognizant of the user&apos;s task.
