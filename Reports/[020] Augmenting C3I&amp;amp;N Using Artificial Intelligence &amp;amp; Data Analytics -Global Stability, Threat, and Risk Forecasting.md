Augmenting C3I&amp;amp;N Using Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Data Analytics:Global Stability, Threat, and Risk Forecasting
==============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Hyperion has direct and immediate application to the Air Forces Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) and other C3I&amp;N systems by providing situational awareness, threat detection, and early warning alerts in support of force planning, readiness assessments, and intelligence operations. Hyperion can be an immediate and substantial force multiplier to all C3I&amp;N missions by using non-traditional data sources, artificial intelligence (AI), and shifting the traditional focus on current activities to one that uses future forecasts of the operational environment.The Hyperion risk and threat assessment platform integrates layers of unclassified data and algorithms to aggregate, categorize, and ingest open source data such as RSS, news feeds, and social media. Hyperions AI analyzes the content of data feeds, calculates stability, makes forecasts, and builds summaries to display global events that impact risk and stability levels. This provides analysts with a powerful tool and an Application Programming Interface (API) that is easily integrated into GCSS-AF and other C3I&amp;N systems.Hyperion addresses key aspects of the Pitch Day in C3I&amp;N BAA, specifically the ability to use commercial AI/ML data exploitation to automatically extract valuable information from massive, multimodal, dynamic data, and ingesting large volumes of data that are not routinely used across the enterprise.
