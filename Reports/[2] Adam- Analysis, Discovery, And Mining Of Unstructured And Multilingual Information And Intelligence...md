Adam- Analysis, Discovery, And Mining Of Unstructured And Multilingual Information And Intelligence
===================================================================================================

# Abstract


This Phase I project investigates and develops technologies, algorithms, and software applications that allow for more robust intelligence analysis and mining for greater situational awareness. Analysis, Discovery, and Mining of Unstructured and Multilingual Information and Intelligence (ADAM) will allow for the efficient processing and mining of two of the greatest challenges facing intelligence operators today: 1) unstructured information in the form of text, graphics, and images 2) processing and analyzing multilingual intelligence information in low-connectivity environments and low-resource languages. This proposal will investigate using Plasticitys prior state-of-the-art work in natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to create novel algorithms for text analytics, classification, and information extraction that can be used for intelligence and surveillance use cases. Many state-of-the-art approaches will be researched and evaluated for their adeptness at these tasks. Furthermore, this proposal will develop a technical feasibility study to be completed at the end of Phase I to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADAM system and algorithms in improving the efficiency and scope intelligence analysts operate on and improving situational awareness.
