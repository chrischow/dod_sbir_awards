ANALYSIS OF BALLISTIC RANGE DATA USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
==============================================================

# Abstract


THE ANALYSIS OF AEROBALLISTIC RANGE DATA IS A TEDIOUS AND TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING TASK. THE SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS PROCEDURES AND REQUIRED SOFTWARE (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) HAVE BEEN REFINED EXTENSIVELY DURING THE PAST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS WITH THE ADDITION OF THE SIX-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM CODES EMPLOYING THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD METHOD. THE REQUIRED PROFICIENCY TAKES BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE YEARS UNDER THE TUTELEDGE OF AN EXPERT AEROBALLISTICIAN. THE INCORPORATION OF A USER FRIENDLY EXPERT SYSTEM INTO THE CURRENT AEROBALLISTIC RANGE DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURES WILL ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF THE REPORTED RESULTS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REQUIRE LESS ENGINEERING MANPOWER, THEREBY REDUCING COST. ARROW TECH AND WPI HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WHICH WILL RESULT IN A SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF AN AI EXPERT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF GUIDING THE USER THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE PROPER INPUTS WHICH ASSURE AN APPROPRIATE LINEAR THEORY ANALYSIS, AND FEEDBACK WITH RESPECT TO INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS.
