# Abstract


To meet the demands of the AF182-041 SBIR solicitation (Militarized Direct RF Conversion Software Defined Radio (SDR)), MaXentric proposes an open source architecture SDR that leverages COTS components coupled with MaXentrics DSP algorithms. The design uses a direct conversion architecture to digitize the RF spectrum at the antenna. This results in an SDR that can analyze the entire EM environment opening new possibilities in terms of intelligent frequency flexible communication. For example, users could scan the EM spectrum and set the radio to transmit on the least crowded band. Furthermore, the proposed design forms the foundation for radically improved radios which leverage artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize spectrum reuse and combat friendly/hostile jamming. The final proposed system will be ruggedized, radiation hardened, electromagnetic pulse resistant and cyber secure. In Phase I, MaXentric will perform a study involving analysis, modeling, simulation, and experimentation to design and estimate the performance of the proposed SDR. During Phase II, the proposed SDR will be fabricated and tested using military waveforms.
