Technical Training Software Platform Using Machine Learningand Ar For Air Force Maintenance And Service Operation
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


A comprehensive technical training software platform combining computer visionand Augmented Reality (AR) technologies can transform the human learningprocess and experience. Computer vision is leveraged to understand the physicalenvironment, while AR is used to superimpose contextual information onto thephysical world. We aim to provide software solution using AR tools and systemsto address specific challenges in technical training of physical systems. Onechallenge with existing AR software platforms is failure of recognizing complexsystems or objects that have small, shiny, or textureless components. In thisSTTR Phase I proposal, we propose to develop specific machine learningalgorithms that can be integrated with state-of-the-art AR technology, to enhanceautomatic object and component recognition and display automatic annotations via AR. With the capability of recognizing components more reliable, accurate,cheaper and faster, the developed machine learning algorithms can improvetechnical training efficiency on complex physical systems using existing ARapplication platform. Focus area: FA-002 Artificial Intelligence (AI).
