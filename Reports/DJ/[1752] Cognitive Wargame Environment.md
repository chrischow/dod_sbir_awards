Cognitive Wargame Environment
=============================

# Abstract


The Cognitive Wargaming Environment (CWE) is developed using commercial gaming technology stacks to implement best-practice architectures on commercial cloud infrastructure; this proven approach routinely supports tens of thousands of unique game-players at a time, and tens of millions of unique players monthly Designed by experienced DoD solution architects, developed in partnership with leading commercial game developers and a leading DoD commercial cloud provider, and migrated to the appropriate network(s) to support wargaming activities in DoD-accredited cloud environments at IL 4-6 or on TS/SCI networks. Built to IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation standards and in strategic partnership with leading innovators in Augmented and Virtual Reality training applications for the Air Force; prepared by design to leverage the coming wave of new AR/VR training systems.  Designed from the ground up, using the best commercial solutions, to make data available for big-data analysis and machine learning projects while protecting gameplayer PII and controlling classified information.  Game-play experience consistent with leading commercial games powered by cross-platform backends, cognitive services, augmented- and artificial-intelligence to create a versatile and dynamic wargame experience.  Scenario and capability development authoring tools offer authorized participants an efficient, AI-assisted code environment to design and deploy new wargames.  Applicable laws of physics such as kinetic motion, line-of-sight and terrain masking applied to each wargame simulation; additional environmental factors such as weather, lighting or air quality can be adjusted within the game.  System behaviors modeled in fine-grained detail to support Multi-Domain Operations wargaming and capability development; includes the ability to deploy and test intelligent agents as part of capability models.  Military doctrines and tactics modeled to faithfully emulate the capabilities and fighting style of U.S. and foreign military forces; adjustable for human factors such as morale and leadership.  Intelligent game summaries and machine-narrated video records of gameplay support rapid review and adjudication by human experts Industry best practices regarding use of open source technologies, licensing, CI/CD, and pricing structure; as an inherently dual-use product, commercial game success will buy-down the long-term cost of building and maintaining CWE.  Given full access to Air Force end-users to support our Lean/Agile methodology, and assuming no significant delays in Air Force information security processes, we believe we can have a well-developed game design document and architecture complete in three months. Full development of the first release of the first version of the game will take approximately 3 years, consistent with commercial game development timelines of 3-5 years.
