SHOPMAN Prototype: Supply Hub for Operational Predictive Maintenance Analytics
==============================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force’s ability to collect, store, and process raw maintenance and inventory data continues to exceed its ability to effectively process it, posing challenges for strategic initiatives such as Condition Based Management Plus (CBM+). Given the USAF stakeholder-identified challenges of interfacing with dated information systems and using available personnel & materiel efficiently, Colvin Run Networks Inc. will prototype a specific configuration of its commercial machine-learning-enabled predictive maintenance and inventory management (PMIM) enhancement solution, called SHOPMAN: Supply Hub for Operational Predictive Maintenance Analytics.
