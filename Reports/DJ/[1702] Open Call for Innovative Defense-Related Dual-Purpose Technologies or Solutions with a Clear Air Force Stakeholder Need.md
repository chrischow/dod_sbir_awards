Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


: Geopipe rapidly and automatically builds virtual environments from the real world by applying new machine learning techniques to aerial and terrestrial sensor data. Geopipe allows training the warfighter in huge, accurate, interactive environments matching the real world without any manual modeling efforts. Geopipe also makes it possible to explore 3D maps of mission areas, with structures, trees, roads, and other objects labeled, built without human analysts.
