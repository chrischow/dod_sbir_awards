AI-Enabled Voice Vetting to Mitigate Foreign Security Threats
=============================================================

# Abstract


AC Global Risk, Inc. (ACGR) proposes support to USAF personnel at a remote and recently attacked Air Force base in Africa with foreign contractor vetting/screening challenges.  ACGR will conduct interviews with our artificial intelligence-enabled voice-vetting technology call Remote Risk Assessment (RRA) designed to detect the absence or presence of risk in the human voice.  After a successful base-period with our commercial product, ACGR will enhance RRA by 1) reducing our interview equipment to a tablet form-factor, 2) creating a mass-enrollment program for 250+ base contractors in 3 languages, 3) integrate RRA into the existing base tip line, and 4) create additional interview question sets in various language according to mission requirements. These adaptations will provide enhanced vetting/screening capabilities and tip line will enable faster and higher quality vetting, actionable insights, and alert to additional foreign threats. With an MOU from down-range base that was recently attacked by terrorist and 4 letters of support from USAF (counterintelligence, Security Force) and the Army (Afghanistan Security Assistance Office, counterintelligence, etc), AC Global Risk is well positioned to greatly enhance the Air Force's vetting/screening capabilities and delivered meaningful outcomes to our MOU sponsors.
