Unmanned Aerial Systems Pitch Day
=================================

# Abstract


The objective of this effort is to provide a drone detection capability based on Artificial Intelligent algorithms. A large need in support of perimeter security is a way to recognize drone threats as early and accurately as possible. Current surveillance camera systems are inadequate to detect drones at a distance to allow effective security response and they also require constant human surveillance to identify the drone threats. Even dedicated security professionals using the best camera system cannot provide 100% real-time observation. There is also the possibility of human error. A proactive solution is needed to detect both drone and gun threats to allow for the most effective airbase defenses.
