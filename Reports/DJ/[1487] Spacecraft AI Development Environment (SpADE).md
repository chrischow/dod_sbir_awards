Spacecraft AI Development Environment (SpADE)
=============================================

# Abstract


The number of spacecraft in orbit and the increasing size of the constellations are driving the need for increased automation and the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to manage them, especially those in large constellations. Timelines to assess the volume of data exceeds human abilities for evaluation, decision making, and action. During the Phase I we will employ a commercial of the shelf space domain simulator to prototype the data and message services necessary to populate a shared data repository with a variety of space data phenomenology types. Multi-phenomenology data is another key aspect of improving AI performance. Since all these products and systems are currently in place, an initial prototype integrating the currently disparate components is feasible within the two-month technical period of performance to demonstrate the Space AI Development Environment (SpADE).
