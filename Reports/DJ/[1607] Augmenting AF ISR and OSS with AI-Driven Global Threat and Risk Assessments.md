Augmenting AF ISR and OSS with AI-Driven Global Threat and Risk Assessments
===========================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force (AF) Operations Support Squadrons (OSS), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Air Operations Centers (AOC), seek a robust technology to transform their OSINT mission and automate publicly available information (PAI) through the use AI technologies. Geospark Analytics looks forward to continue to build the force of the future and building upon the significant milestones it has already reached to bring users to the next level of actionable intelligence. Geospark Analytics' Hyperion offers artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that automate risk and threat intelligence forecasts. Using PAI from news, social media, open government and NGO sources, Hyperionâ€™s applied machine learning (ML) models are continually assessing risk and activity at the global, country, region, and city levels on real-time events. Phase II objective is to enhance our commercial solution, Hyperion, with aero-specific content and develop unique ML-modeling to bring OSS and ISR units AF specific threat and risk assessments. This is directly applicable to AF operations and intelligence missions. Specifically, Phase I exhibited Hyperion as an immediate and substantial force multiplier to OSS, ISR and AOC missions by shifting analysis of current activities to a future forecast of the operational environment.
