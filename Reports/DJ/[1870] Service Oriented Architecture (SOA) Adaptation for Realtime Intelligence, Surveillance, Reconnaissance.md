Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Adaptation for Realtime Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
======================================================================================================

# Abstract


The rate at which ISR assets can currently disseminate data and be re-tasked to evaluate new threats is limited by the stove-piped nature of existing ISR systems and their inability to operate with other data distribution systems. This lack of interoperability can lead to delays in the prosecution of a target. By contrast, a Service Oriented Architecture that could be successfully integrated with legacy ISR systems, and that could be extensible and adaptable for future expansion and connection with the Global information Grid, would provide the means for rapid, real-time dissemination of intelligence to warfighters. Couple this faster information dissemination with artificial intelligence that can dynamically allocate ISR resources, and the result can  provide warfighters with the information to make critical decisions in substantially less time, saving lives in the process. There are technical challenges to be met, and Lakota will apply the experience gained from its involvement in similar efforts to determine the feasibility and identify the risks in applying this approach to ISR Sensor system networking.BENEFITS: The implementation of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) will enable ISR assets to be dynamically allocated and controlled through the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. It will also allow interoperation among the myriad of heterogeneous legacy, existing, and anticipated Joint Force standards. The dynamic nature of SOA creates a loose coupling of discrete software components and will give the Navy a competitive advantage over its adversaries by dramatically reducing the time between target acquisition and target destruction.
