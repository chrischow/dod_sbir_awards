Molecula Data Virtualization Software that modernize data access for the US Air Force to make real-time and better decisions
============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


  Molecula’s Enterprise Data Virtualization platform simplifies, accelerates, and controls data access for Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, and Edge/IoT. Its unique ability to deliver highly-performant representations of large, disparate data sources eliminates the need to pre-aggregate or federate, thus reducing data delivery cycles and data gravity. Users have access to low-latency, ad-hoc queries with at least 1000x improved performance and up to 100x reduced hardware footprint. Its management framework grants access to cell-level data, audits usage, tracks lineage, and manages infrastructure resources with improved governance and regulatory compliance. Molecula will give the Department of Defence a huge advantage in being able to analyze and process large volume of data across multiple systems and locations, to make real-time and more accurate decisions with Artificial Intelligence and Business Intelligence.
