Development of Novel Knowledge-Based Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) Techniques Using Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
==========================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Virtual EM Inc. proposes to develop STAP techniques using machine learning algorithms for eventual implementation in critical radar systems. These algorithms require less time to train than neural networks. Virtual EM's simulation packages will be used to train the algorithms for array element failure, multi-path and jamming mitigation as well as interference from ground and maritime clutter. The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated in comparison to conventional reduced order STAP techniques.
