GREEN REVOLUTION COOLING – LIQUID IMMERSION COOLING FOR AI DATA CENTERS
=======================================================================

# Abstract


The United States Air Force (USAF) has committed to embracing all aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI).   When implementing AI into existing organization infrastructure, many aspects must be considered, however no AI application would be possible without correct physical infrastructure.  As increasingly higher levels of computation power are needed for AI, electricity usage and heat generation also increase,  leading to the need for innovative data cooling solutions. Green Revolution Cooling (GRC) is leading the scientific innovation driving the next wave of data cooling solutions suitable for AI.  GRC’s objective is to create data cooling solutions that are robust, conserve valuable space and are extremely power efficient.  GRC’s R&D focuses on the design and scale-up of novel data cooling solutions, for industry and government partners, adhering to specific and challenging operational requirements.  Their innovation lies in their expert command of Liquid Immersion Cooling, where data servers are immersed in a cooling rack filled with a proprietary, nontoxic, non-conductive coolant called ElectroSafe™, which provides 1200X the heat capacity of air.  Heat from the servers is absorbed by the coolant and quickly removed from the rack. The result is a supremely energy-efficient data center cooling system with a cooling capacity up to 100 kW/rack.  An average target for traditional data centers is only 7 kW per rack, whereas it is not unheard of for an AI application to use upwards of 30 kW per rack.   Therefore, GRC’s immersion cooling solutions are suitable for today’s AI needs, and are prepared to handle exponentially more data as progress inevitably continues.  By switching away from legacy data cooling systems to utilizing GRC’s liquid immersion cooling solutions, a data center can expect to see up to 90% reduction of cooling energy consumption. During this Phase I project, GRC objectives will include: Contacting the Air Force Chief Data Office in order to gather use cases, process information, and align with the needs and goals of current Chief Data Office development projects. Evaluate the technical feasibility of reaching the objectives set forth by this team and the needs of the USAF, by performing tasks and integrating GRC technology R&D with existing USAF technologies. Determine the most appropriate pilot project. Partner with a team to design a technically achievable pilot plan that incorporates GRC technology and satisfies both the Air Force Chief Data Office requirements and requirements specified by other stakeholders in the USAF.
