Smart Document Processing- Leveraging Intelligent Process Automation BPM + RPA + OCR/ICR/CV + AI/ML
===================================================================================================

# Abstract


User-Friendly and Cost-Effective solution for document processing using Software Bots that includes the following benefits: low technical barrier(low code), increased accuracy, meets compliance standards, 24/7 operations, improved employee morale, increased productivity and expedited decision-making for Air Force personnel. Converging the abilities of automation with innovative technologies that can “see” and understand documents and data in context - much like humans – intelligent bots will radically increase the sophistication of business processes we can automate. Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) is this next level of in business process workflow, with the capability to understand documents, recognize patterns, predict actions, and self-improve over time to expedite decision-making and automate mundane tasks. IPA combines Business Process Management + Robotic Process Automation + Intelligent Optical Character Recognition + Machine Learning to deliver game-changing, smart document processing to benefit any Air Force offices with processes burdened by forms that require manual entry into systems, checking the validity of the information in other systems, and approval processes.
