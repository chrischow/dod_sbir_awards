Immersive Suicide Prevention Training
=====================================

# Abstract


Moth+Flame’s solution melds state-of-the-art cinematography with cutting edge VR environment creation with the power of conversational Natural Language Processing. Our front-end techniques and technologies improve the fluency of human-computer interactions and create visceral synthetic experiences that humanize our VR experiences. Moth+Flame’s front-end experiences sit on a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) cloud stack that delivers user analytics that were never measurable in the past, such as: sentiment analysis, decision flow and tendencies, visual gaze and verbal cueing insights.  Not only does the technology solution provide increased levels of user engagement, but also it provides feedback on the sentiment, tendencies and trends that were previously unidentifiable. Moth + Flame has deployed this system commercially for Netflix in one of the biggest real-time immersive launches ever reaching over 500,000 users in a 24-hour period in over 200 countries. The Moth+Flame conversational VR training solution enables organizational training & learning departments to deliver scalable and consistent training without sacrificing quality.  We solve the brick-and-mortar constraints of traditional training and ensure training is effective, efficient, and impactful.
