Commercial Solutions for Resilient PNT in Degraded Environments
===============================================================

# Abstract


The goal of this project is to identify and rapidly adapt commercial solutions, to ensure impervious access to PNT data by defense customers. This approach leverages the decades of infrastructure investment into the GPS system, by focusing on resilient access or augmentation, as opposed to its replacement. Of particular importance is the inter-operability of new solutions with one-another and existing systems. Additionally, particular focus is given to multi-path environments of the modern, urban battlefield, which can compound existing threats and limitations, yielding current solutions inoperable. Specific technologies to investigated, which are currently under development by the proposing team, include: digital beamforming using sparse arrays, and machine learning assisted mapping of multi-path environments.
