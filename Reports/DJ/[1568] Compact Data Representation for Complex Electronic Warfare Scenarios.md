Compact Data Representation for Complex Electronic Warfare Scenarios
====================================================================

# Abstract


Vadum will conduct a trade study to define the architecture and specify the requirements for the Electronic Warfare Knowledge Store (EWKS), an emitter representation to supplement and extend existing library-based (EWIR) emitter recognition and response programming. The EWKS representation will combine an adaptable model layer to support emitter recognition and inference with an ontology layer that captures a snapshot of observed and inferred emitter behavior. The layers leverage one another to support the creation and maintenance of inference objects based on models; support relational assessment of emitters and emitter behaviors; and support model extensions to accommodate new and anomalous signals. EWKS will enable offline merging, dynamic offline and online updates, training of offline machine learning algorithms for online recognition and inference, relational pattern discovery, and distributed correlation.
