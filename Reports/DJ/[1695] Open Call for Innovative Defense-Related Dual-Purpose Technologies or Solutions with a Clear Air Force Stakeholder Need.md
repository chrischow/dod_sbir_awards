# Abstract


VFusion is a human intelligence-based decision support platform that uses an Expert Systems approach to guide machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. It enables the development and delivery of highly trusted man-machine symbiosis for detection, prediction, alerting, and explainable decision support across multi-disciplinary, multi-use case, and multi-domain operations. Real-time â€œfusionâ€ of human intelligence with both structured and unstructured information systems support the ability of VFusion to: (a) perform complex event processing; (b) use pattern recognition to learn from experience; (c) understand contextual nuances, and (d) create new insights. CTA will utilize its existing VFusion semantic reasoning engine, enhanced ML/AI, and integrated workflow automation to effectively process AFSC 448 SCMW procurement instrument (PI) packages. Once complete, PI process automation is expected to significantly reduce the average 30-days required to process PI packages. With the 448th processing more than 10K PI annually, we anticipate tremendous operational improvements in savings, efficiency and quality of PI end-products â€“ thereby improving weapons systems readiness throughout the Air Force. The 448th SCMW, 431 SCMS, 429 SCMS, and 422 SCMS have expressed interest in supporting a Phase II effort, with the expectation is that a Phase III program could eventually support more than 2,500 SCMW administrative employees.
