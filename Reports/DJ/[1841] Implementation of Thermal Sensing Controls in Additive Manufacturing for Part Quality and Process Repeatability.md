Implementation of Thermal Sensing Controls in Additive Manufacturing for Part Quality and Process Repeatability
===============================================================================================================

# Abstract


Stratonics, Inc. proposes to tightly integrate their modular thermal monitoring and control system across multiple additive manufacturing processes to create robust platforms, capable of consistent part quality and process repeatability. Software/hardware interface modules will be developed in a production ready solution with true temperature monitoring and active thermal controls to record key thermal metrics indicating process quality such as critical temperature points, thermal decay and thermal area profile. Thermal analysis and post process evaluation data will be correlated utilizing big data analytics to define key thermal signatures relative to deficient material and microscopic properties. Trial iterations of selecting part, process, and characterization parameters will be conducted to capture the depth of data required to establish and validate methods to transfer thermal history and process controls from machine to machine, and process to process. Economic analysis of the thermal process control allowing correction or abortion of AM processes, will be analyzed in terms of unit-cost reduction through increased yield. This innovative technology can assist in the establishment of key performance parameters and required methodologies necessary to achieve an economically viable approach to AM and is essential in the adoption of certified parts.
