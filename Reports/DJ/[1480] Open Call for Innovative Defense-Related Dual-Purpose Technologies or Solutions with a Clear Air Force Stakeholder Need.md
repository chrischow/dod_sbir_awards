Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Jiobit provides a tracking device that is less than 1 cubic inch in volume and only 0.6 ounces in weight that can easily be attached to personnel or cargo. The device includes a GPS receiver, 3G/2G global cellular transceiver, BT/WIFI transceivers, and motion and altitude sensors. The device and related infrastructure use a patented technique termed "progressive beaconing" to save power, actively switching between the available technologies for location acquisition and location communication, giving the small device up to 10 days of battery life. The device includes an "SOS" button that can be manually triggered but the infrastructure can also provide monitoring of "safe zones" set up by the user or other authorized "watchers". These zones can be manually established or can be automatically established through machine learning of "normal" routines. The system can also be customized to insure teams remain intact and provide warning if a team member leaves the group beyond BT range.
