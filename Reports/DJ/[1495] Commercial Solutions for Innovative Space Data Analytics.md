Commercial Solutions for Innovative Space Data Analytics
========================================================

# Abstract


We propose a collaborative, shared immersive virtual environment where humans can interact with satellite data and other space assets, with machine intelligence tools, and with each other in an intuitive manner to enable rapid analytics and decision-making of the space environment. The software we propose would essentially enable participants (from potentially disparate locations) to be inside a 3D environment depicting the location of the various space assets (plus any abstract data pertaining to such assets) , with the ability to run easy to use machine learning tools in order to find relevant insights pertaining to the data being visualized. Being immersed in such an environment would allow for an improvement in identification, understanding and response to an evolving situation in space, where multiple factors are involved. This will be an interactive, multi-user virtual environment, where users can interact between each other and with complex data and analysis tools. Our existing technology is based on over 10 years of research at Caltech and NASA/JPL. We are currently under contract with the Naval Special Warfare command, and have received very positive feedback from them on our work (please see application for detailed information).
