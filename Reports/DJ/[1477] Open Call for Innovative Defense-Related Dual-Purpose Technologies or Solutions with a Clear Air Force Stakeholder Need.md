# Abstract


Communication bandwidth is precious, and transmission of real-time digital video can often be challenging or infeasible. We have developed a machine learning-based imagery codec that can compress videos and still images far beyond the current state-of-the-art, requiring just 20% of the throughput to transmit HD video as the leading industry codecs (HEVC/h.265). It can run in real-time on computationally limited devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones)
