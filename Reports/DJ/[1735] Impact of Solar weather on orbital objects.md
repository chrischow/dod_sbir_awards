==========================================

# Abstract


Space Vehicle Engineers of 1st Space Operations Squadron of Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado needs effective tracking & insights of improved space domain activities so as to predict the stationkeeping maneuver schedule of satellites in GEO based on historical observations. They need to understand what combination of observations, spatially and temporally, lead to the best quality ephemerides and also  need to understand the causal relationship between space weather events and spacecraft anomalies; Blue Eye Soft Corp (BES) an advanced data analytics and AFRL Catalyst Space Accelerator Data Fusion cohort company intends leverage leveraging data fusion to improve the effectiveness of our space domain awareness (SDA) activities.BES proposes the solution which is built on the combination of time-tested algorithms in collaboration with open source Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Predictive Analytics, Data Modelling and Data Science tools, will cost effectively enable automating repetitive decision-making, large-scale pattern recognition, dynamic visualization of the Space Domain Data. The solution will be built using modular, Plug & Play approach (Lego Model), which is not a monolithic solution. It can be extended with newer functionality with ease.Proposed BES optional Integration platform will have 100s of pre-built connectors to ERPs, RDBMS and other data sources which allows us to quickly integrate to any platform, allowing us to use the siloed data without awaiting the completion of the consolidated data warehouses.BES Solution will be built in way that it is  independent of the underlying integration platforms.Our AI & ML Models as well as Data Models are easy to reuse across all domains and siloes of Space Domain.
