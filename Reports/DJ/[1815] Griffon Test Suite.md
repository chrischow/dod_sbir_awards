Griffon Test Suite
==================

# Abstract


In this proposal we support the development of a hypoxia test battery by designing and developing a domain general tool suite for processing, synchronizing, and evaluating data from cognitive, behavioral, and physiological measures.The proposed Griffon Tool Suite addresses many of the practical requirements demanded by a flexible test battery. The effort falls into three major thrusts.First, we propose a systematic evaluation of the symptoms and measures used to study hypoxia.Second, we focus on the development of system for supporting the use of multimodal data.This involves not only supporting the processing of raw data, but also methods for aligning data collected from different sources and across different time-courses.Finally, we set forth standards, methods, and experimental designs for evaluating the hypoxia test battery. This general metric evaluation design aid leverages statistical and machine learning approaches to identify valid, reliable, and practical measures for inclusion in test batteries. In pursuing these three thrusts, the Griffon Tool Suite aims to offer a test battery, a support tool for using that test battery, and a flexibility for adapting that test battery to apply to the measurement of different conditions affecting human performance in extreme environments.
