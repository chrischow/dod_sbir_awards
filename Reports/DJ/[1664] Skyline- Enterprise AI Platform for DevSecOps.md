Skyline- Enterprise AI Platform for DevSecOps
=============================================

# Abstract


Recent innovations in Cloud computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) have allowed Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications to be commonplace in our daily lives. Online shopping platforms utilize machine learning recommendation engines to provide custom buying experiences and instant purchase recommendations based on historical consumer data. These ML models leverage immense consumer data sources and enable users to get insights into consumer behaviors necessary to make informed buying decisions. Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have developed digital assistant technologies that are plugged into our daily activities and help us work across our homes and personal information systems. All these technologies require a platform to train, manage, and improve AI/ML models for commercial use cases. The US Government is lacking this capability, and there is not a common place for agencies to develop, implement, host, and share AI models for defense use cases in a secure and controlled environment. Intrinsic developed Skyline as a commercial platform for this exact purpose.
