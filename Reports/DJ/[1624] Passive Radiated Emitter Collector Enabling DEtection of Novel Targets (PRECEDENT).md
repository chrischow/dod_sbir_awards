Passive Radiated Emitter Collector Enabling DEtection of Novel Targets (PRECEDENT)
==================================================================================

# Abstract


The PRECEDENT system leverages a existing emissions and signatures to detect, identify, characterize, track, and categorize low flying objects. The PRECEDENT system can be deployed in urban areas with no impact to existing services. PRECEDENT may be deployed in remote areas requiring only power and uplink capabilities to space or ground based cloud infrastructure. Using existing emissions, PRECEDENT employs machine learning algorithmsÂ to categorized threat notifications in near-real-time to human operators or high-value-assets.
