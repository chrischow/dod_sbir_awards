Total Exposure Monitoring System
================================

# Abstract


Occupational and environmental exposure is a major workforce health risk at military facilities, contributing to spikes in stress for high performance pilots and increased risk of long-term exposure linked illnesses for personnel in industrial settings. Cost-effective occupational exposure sensor networks and personal monitoring systems have developed rapidly over the last few years and offer the opportunity to make occupational exposure monitoring widespread at an affordable price. However, the advancement of these monitoring technologies requires an equally effective data analytics infrastructure to draw insights and make informed decisions.
