Advanced Intelligent Web-Based Options to Acquire and Analyze Aircraft Health and Test Data
===========================================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal focuses on the development of an innovative, web-based application to help solve one of the fundamental problems facing aircraft management today: data management.  This problem is outlined as follows. Aircraft health management is data-driven. A broad range of disparate data sources exist, many of which are essential for accurate, near real-time aircraft health monitoring and maintenance. These data sources are often incompatible with each other, in terms of source (measured aircraft response, maintenance data, analytical models, etc.), storage (different computer systems), format (paper, electronic: ASCII, binary, spreadsheet, warehoused in relational database), architecture (procedural, object-relational, object-oriented), and design (open source, proprietary or unique design). A solution must address the following five (5) key issues: 1. Acquisition – pulling data from all required sources, 2. Integration – tying all meaningful information together into one aircraft “entity”, 3. Analysis – turning data into decision, 4. Exchange – sharing within the larger community and promoting collaboration, and 5. Data advancement – pushing data downstream for further use and innovation.
