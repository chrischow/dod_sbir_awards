Using AI/ML to produce geospatial human data and predictive threat models in support of AFWIC mission requirements
==================================================================================================================

# Abstract


We are interested in attending the pitch day. Fraym will create geospatially-enabled information on local population characteristics to inform Air Force (AF) missions in critical AORs. In addition to providing rich human data, Fraym will work with AF customers to build predictive models that anticipate threats or significant events in these AORs.   Specifically, Fraym will produce and deliver 60+ categories of high-resolution population information in at least two geographies of interest for AFWIC and other AF/DoD stakeholders.  We will combine survey data with satellite imagery via advanced machine learning models to create local population data for each AOR. We will also develop models that use this human data plus open-source or government-furnished data to anticipate threats/significant events. In commercial work, we have successfully used this approach to assess risk of terrorism, unrest, and political violence. We anticipate that our approach, when tailored for AFWIC, will provide critical insight for training, mission planning, strategy development, situational awareness, and information campaigns. In particular, we will inform training curriculum and exercises for the newly developed information operations career field within AF, supporting use case development, data integration, and methodologies. We will also explore applications for other AF/DoD stakeholders.
