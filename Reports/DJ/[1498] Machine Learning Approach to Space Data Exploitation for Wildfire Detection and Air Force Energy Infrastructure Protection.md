Machine Learning Approach to Space Data Exploitation for Wildfire Detection and Air Force Energy Infrastructure Protection
==========================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Enview's 3D Geospatial Analytics Engine's new Wildfire Risk module encapsulates core capabilities of exploiting Air Force space data to identify Wildfire threats, predict their spread, and enable first-responders and civilians to respond to fires. The capability will fuse space-based infrared, electro-optical (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery and weather sensing data, with ground and aerial collected LiDAR to build a wide-area 3D model of wildfire risk. Enview's 3D Computer Vision algorithms will detect vegetation density and health, electric powerlines & powerpoles, commercial and residential structures, and other infrastructure. It will use deep learning algorithms to predict the spread of wildfire, optimize plans to respond to current and future wildfires.
