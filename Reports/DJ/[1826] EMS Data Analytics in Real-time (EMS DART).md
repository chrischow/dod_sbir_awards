EMS Data Analytics in Real-time (EMS DART)
==========================================

# Abstract


The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an architecture design for a real-time monitoring, analysis, and notification solution for underserved EMS organizations at an affordable cost. Two efforts will be completed as part of the proposed research: 
1)	High performance EMS organizations of different sizes and constraints will be researched to identify a common set of key performance indicators (KPIs). 
2)	Database technologies and methods will be researched to determine the optimal approach to extracting information from a database with minimum knowledge of its structure and contents.

The proposed research efforts will produce a common set of KPIs against which EMS organizations of different sizes and constraints can measure performance, and which can be used by DHS to develop guidance and best practices for operations management. The database research will produce a foundation for developing an automated database query method necessary to develop an analytics solution available to underserved EMS organizations at an affordable cost.

Ambulance companies, community based and regional EMS organizations, 9-1-1 dispatch centers, and hospital based dispatch centers are all public safety organizations which would benefit from the proposed research. This market represents tens of thousands of organizations that would benefit from the proposed research. By identifying common high performing EMS KPIs and providing an affordable solution for underserved EMS organizations, the level of patient care will be elevated.
