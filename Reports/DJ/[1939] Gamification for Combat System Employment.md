Gamification for Combat System Employment
=========================================

# Abstract


This effort will develop a design for a gaming structure for the AN/SQQ-89A (V) 15 Surface Ship Undersea Warfare Combat System (AV15). Player assessment will derive from a a novel, next generation automated instructional tool which will recognize the student's behavior and measure it against an expert standard, enabling a dynamic, adaptive learning simulation. The technical approach will rely on two machine-learning based components that will form the core of the Intelligent Gaming System: the intelligent scoring and intelligent mastery modules. These modules facilitate personalized instruction strategies, adaptive gamification and informative after-action reviews, all of which foster deeper learning and effective strategic thinking.
