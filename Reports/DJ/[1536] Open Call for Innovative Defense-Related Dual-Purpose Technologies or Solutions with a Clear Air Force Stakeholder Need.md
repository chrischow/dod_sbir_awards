Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


With physical fitness as a prime concern for those in the Air Force, more rigorous physical fitness standards were implemented in 2010 becoming the most strenuous in over a decade. Meanwhile, Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 are becoming more overweight and obese making many unfit to even qualify to serve in the Air Force. Those that do qualify find their poor fitness can quickly lead to injuries or they donâ€™t have basic motor skills needed to get through an obstacle course during basic training. Utilizing a fitness training app can help all service members get on track for physical fitness, maintain, or improve it. The Volt Next-Generation fitness application is the worldâ€™s first performance training app to utilize artificial intelligence technology to help deliver a perfectly customized workout to support Airmen both physically and mentally. This technology has been featured by ESPN, NCAA Champion, and GeekWire to name a few. Using a team of coaches, sports scientist, technology engineers and AI technology called Cortex, Volt Next-Gen creates a customized scalable fitness training program that meets the service member where they are in their physical fitness journey and helps the Air Force be combat ready at all times.
