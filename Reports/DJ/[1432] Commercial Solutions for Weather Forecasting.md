Commercial Solutions for Weather Forecasting
============================================

# Abstract


The proposed Soil Moisture Advancements from Research to Transition (SMART) solution will adapt IBMâ€™s Physical Analytics Integrated Repository and Services (PAIRS) Geoscope and the Watson Agriculture Package commercial technologies and use them as the basis for a novel Machine-learning (ML) system. SMART will establish a containerized service to build and deliver machine-learned soil moisture datasets and implement a data science workflow to accelerate R&D of new ML-based weather products and tools. The objectives of this effort are to (1) Establish a Weather Data Science Lab (WxDSL) that will provide a domain for researchers to share data, algorithms, and results; (2) Provide a sustainable soil moisture product that is at least as good as SMAP Level 4 data products; (3) Provide trafficability relationships to soil moisture products using the WxDSL to work out new approaches to deriving trafficability; (4) Enable Independent validation and verification (V&V) and provide results.
