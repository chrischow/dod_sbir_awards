Development of an Autonomous Recovery Function for eVTOL Aircraft Using an Adaptive / ML Controller
===================================================================================================

# Abstract


Jump Aero has partnered with Caltech’s Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST) to move adaptive control and machine learning autonomy algorithms from the lab to the real world.  We will accomplish this transition through an incremental crawl-walk-run process where the first crawl step involves a combination of certifiable hardware and a software architecture that is based on Run Time Assurance (RTA) with a certifiable System Monitor and an adaptive/ML recovery function developed at CAST.
