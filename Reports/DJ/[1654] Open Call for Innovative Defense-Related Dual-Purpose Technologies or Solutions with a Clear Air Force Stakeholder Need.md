# Abstract


Protagonistâ€™s Narrative-Based Emergent Crisis Detection (NECD) system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict the likelihood that a major crisis (e.g. war, coup dâ€™ etat, civil disturbance) may emerge in a country of interest by tracking changes in the dominant narratives in that country. Every country has a set of â€œmasterâ€ narratives that help define the shared beliefs and identity of large segments of its population (e.g. the â€œAmerican Dream" narrative in the United States). These master narratives are invoked throughout the public discourse in response to a variety of national events, in particular in times of upheaval or crisis. NECDâ€™s ML algorithms learn to detect the master narratives in a given countryâ€™s media discourse (traditional media outlets and social media), quantify their strength, and track changes in their strength over time. NECD uses both current and historical data to correlate changes in the strength of these narratives with the emergence of crisis situations in the target country. Over time, NECD builds a predictive model that allows it to assess the probability that future crises will emerge, based on changes in the strength of the master narratives in the media discourse.
