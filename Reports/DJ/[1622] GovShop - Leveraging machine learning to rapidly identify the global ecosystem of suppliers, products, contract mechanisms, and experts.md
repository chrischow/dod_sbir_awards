GovShop: Leveraging machine learning to rapidly identify the global ecosystem of suppliers, products, contract mechanisms, and experts.
=======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Under the proposed effort, Public Spend Forum will expand the set of 1.6 million suppliers within its market intelligence tool, Govshop, to include a global network of suppliers across defense and commercial categories which can be researched and deployed across the needs of the Air Force and the defense department; and further develop the matching and validation algorithms that will allow Air Force personnel to identify and vet suppliers based on various criteria such as capability, risk, and scalability. The mission impact and outcomes of this project on the Air Force and the Department of Defense will be the ability to: 1) rapidly identify emerging technologies across traditional and non-traditional defense contractors; 2) identify local sources of supply anywhere in the world; 3) provide transparency into a comprehensive supplier network in terms of capability and geographical coverage; and 4) Validate sources of supply in limited time in terms of risk and ability to successful perform efforts within the Air Force and DOD.
