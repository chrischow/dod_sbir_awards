# Abstract


Stardog is an enterprise knowledge graph platform that allows customers to query massive, disparate, heterogeneous data regardless of structure with simplicity of implementation. We use artificial intelligence to help organizations operationalize all their data and find hidden insights. Unlike other solutions, Stardog works across all data types, regardless of where the data resides. Stardogâ€™s enterprise customers include Fortune 500 companies in finance, healthcare, life sciences, energy, media, and government. Stardogâ€™s Knowledge Graph Platform uniquely addresses the US Air Forceâ€™s enterprise platform goal. A Knowledge Graph Platform allows the USAF to query multiple disparate datasets in place, at the source, allowing the unique systems maintained by USAF commands to continue to fulfill the mission they were designed to do. The platform also identifies relationships between the data, across the silos, and provides lineage for those relationships. Stardog's Knowledge Graph Platform provides a unified view across data and the ability to understand the connections that exist within the data, across silos.
