# Abstract


Oral bacteria (â€œfloraâ€) are a known cause of dental disease. Until now there has not be a good way to accurately identify these bacteria, or diagnose diseases caused by these bacteria. We have a proprietary technology (provisional patent granted) allowing us to accurately identify oral flora using microbiome and genetic testing. We have developed an screening platform that has the capability to analyze and interpret individual patient data and assess the risk for gum and dental implant-related diseases through a built-in prediction model by artificial intelligence (AI) applications including patients oral microbiome data, genetics, clinical data, and dental radiographs.
