Model Based Systems Engineering Big Data Analytics
==================================================

# Abstract


The amount of cross-domain data available to the designer today, and the speed at which it continues to grow is unprecedented. The data often come from heterogeneous sources that were developed independently, without a consensus on the syntax or semantics. The integration of the heterogeneous data is possible because of the access to its respective metadata, or data about data. The availability of vast amounts of cross-domain data led to the development of the Big Data (BD) technologies - a wide range of new standards, processing paradigms, architectures and frameworks, that are being actively applied in virtually all domains. BD tools are capable of discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in vast amounts of data. The analytics utilize algorithms from across different fields, such as distributed machine learning, data mining, pattern mining or computer vision, to name a few. The challenge of comprehending entire DT goes well beyond the scope of the proposed work. VIStology and Raytheon are proposing to focus primarily on the Capabilities-Based Assessment and develop methods and tools that leverage Big Data Analytics (BDA) supported by semantic technologies to extract and link design artifacts from common engineering documents to conduct trade space exploration.
