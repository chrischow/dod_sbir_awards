Rapid construction of 3-D Satellite models from limited amounts of 2-D imagery
==============================================================================

# Abstract


Increases in space traffic have caused an ever-growing need to recognize, track, and determine the operational state of both known and unknown satellites in-situ. Imagery from ground and/or space-based observation platforms provide a convenient and versatile data source for such characterization but is often limited in both quantity and quality. Rapid and automated 3D reconstruction of satellite models from limited 2D imagery would significantly reduce the burden of manual satellite characterization for both analysts and decision makers. VSI proposes Sat3D, a 3D satellite modeling capability from limited input data based on an innovative and proven probabilistic reconstruction framework. The VSI team is well suited to program challenges, with expertise in remote sensing, 3D modeling, computer vision, and machine learning.
