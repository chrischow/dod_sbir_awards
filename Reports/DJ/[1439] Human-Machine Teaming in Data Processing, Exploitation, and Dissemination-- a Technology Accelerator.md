Human-Machine Teaming in Data Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination-- a Technology Accelerator
====================================================================================================

# Abstract


Cognovi Labs' technology uses machine learning to identify the emotions in large volumes of unstructured text, applying models informed by behavioral psychology to quantify the authorsâ€™ motivation to act. Through this effort, Cognovi will expand the capabilities of its core emotion identification subsystem to operate on non-English text, gain the ability to collect and process data from multiple new sources, and provide a signal for incorporation into extremist violence Indications & Warning processes. Specific languages and sources will be based upon information received from ongoing customer discovery and requirements elicitation efforts. Cognovi will integrate the new prototype capabilities with its existing ones, to be deployed on a separate, secure, ITAR-compliant cloud environment, and the prototype system will be demonstrated to an end-user and/or technical point of contact.
