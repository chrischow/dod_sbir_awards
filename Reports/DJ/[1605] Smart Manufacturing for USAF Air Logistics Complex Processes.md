Smart Manufacturing for USAF Air Logistics Complex Processes
============================================================

# Abstract


In 90 days, Murano Corporation will demonstrate the following to the United States Air Force: Smart Manufacturing | Digital Transformation: A digital version of Air Logistics Complex (ALC) end-to-end manufacturing, repair, quality, and supply chain business processes Digital Twin: Capability combining 3D drawings and equipment performance, maintenance, and supply chain data. We define Digital twin as a digital replica of potential and actual physical assets, processes, people, places, systems, and devices that can be used for various purposes. Future Phases: Aircraft sensor data integration with Boeing (strategic partner). 3D Printing | Additive Manufacturing: Integrated 3D printing from the Smart Manufacturing platform using 3D Drawing and Bill of Material data Predictive Intelligence: Predict future repairs based on several factors (operators, missions, mechanics, depots, repair parts used, locations, weather, etc.) versus the current basic repair prediction models RFID | Barcode Scanning | Tablet Scanners: Improved asset accuracy, tracking, and visibility with a combination of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), barcode labels, and tablet scanners Manufacturing Tablet | Mobile | Cloud Technology: A modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled secure cloud-based manufacturing/repair tablet for the ALC maintainers with electronic work instructions, 3D drawings, technical manuals, supply chain data, aircraft performance and service history. This aggressive but realistic schedule is possible because we will be reusing our extensive digital assets: We demonstrated these capabilities (except 3D Printing and RFID) to the United States Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) in September 2020 as part of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I. We have high TRL assets developed over the past 10 years and operationalized for Honda and their parts manufacturers; our cloud AI platform called Supply Chain Manager is Honda approved. Murano Corporation demonstrated cloud-based AI enabled repair tablets' following features to the United States: Integrate Technical Manuals (TMs) from platform manufacturers and internally developed instructions and make the manuals available in digital and potentially graphical formats including engineering drawings and part numbers Can be used to easily capture and digitize “tribal” knowledge using digital media (audio, videos, photos, etc.) Have the ability to create and update work orders by both platform operators and mechanics Have a “Google” type search engine for troubleshooting tips, repair instructions, work order history, repair parts orders, platform performance, depot details, service history, operator, mechanics history, engineering drawings, etc. Have a “YouTube” like platform to display repair instruction videos Have a question and answer site for mechanics and operators for repair related topics (like Stack Overflow)
