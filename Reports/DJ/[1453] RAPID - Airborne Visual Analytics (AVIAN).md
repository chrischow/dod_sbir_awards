RAPID: Airborne Visual Analytics (AVIAN)
========================================

# Abstract


In this Phase II SBIR project, UtopiaCompression (UC) will adapt its stack of Visual Analytics technologies, including its commercial Maritime Visual Analytics (MVA) product, to an Airborne Visual Analytics (AVIAN) system for combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions. The AVIAN system uses a gimbaled camera sensor on board an unmanned aircraft to search an area for survivors on land or at sea. Computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms detect, track, and authenticate humans. AVIAN is part of a future manned-unmanned CSAR CONOPS under development by the USAF. This CONOPS exploits automation to greatly improve CSAR relative to the conventional paradigm, in use for several decades.
