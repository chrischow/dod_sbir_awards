Cognitive Augmentation for Distributed Command and Control
==========================================================

# Abstract


A key element for North Americaâ€™s defense is air domain dominance. Achieving this requires NORAD Battle Control Centers (BCCs) to have a complete understanding of the friendly and foe actors in the airspace, and then form and execute (in real time) both defensive and offensive air battle plans, which are woven into the overall battle plans for land, sea, air, space, and now cyber space domains. Timely and accurate understanding of the position, trajectory, and intent of all actors in the air domain is required to prevail and maintain air superiority. The objective of this STTP is to provide critical sensemaking capability to counter emerging threats in the cyber domain that result in impacts to Air Defense Operations. Ubiquitous networked sensors and machine learning computing techniques have the potential to identify nefarious behaviors and indicators of cyber influence. JCAUSE will increase cyber situational awareness of Air Surveillance personnel in the context of the ongoing mission.
