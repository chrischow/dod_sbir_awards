Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Active Duty Dental Readiness (ADDR) is a major issue for the Air Force and the wider DoD. Dental conditions can render a soldier non-deployable, and cause soldiers to lose an average of three days of duty each time they need dental care. We want to take a leading teledentistry platform, and modify it using our Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) expertise to produce a significant improvement in levels of dental readiness. Our solution is to use teledentistry and AI/ML technologies to significantly improve Dental Readiness, as measured by Percent Class 1 and Percent Class 1 and 2, by providing a more accurate, efficient, and effective diagnosis of dental conditions in advance. This allows us to predict who needs dental care, enable that care to take place, and therefore achieve and maintain deployment status. We have 2 potential Air Force customers already interviewed and others identified who are interested in a solution. To compliment, a number of major non-defense active customers are excited about this technology and developments that can be utilized from this project. In Phase I and II we will work to understand Air Force customer needs, feasibility, and refine our solution to for a â€œshovel readyâ€� project.
