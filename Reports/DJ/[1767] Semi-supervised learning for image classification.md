Semi-supervised learning for image classification
=================================================

# Abstract


Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (with no labeled training data) and supervised learning (with only labeled training data). Unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy. The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent or a physical experiment.  The cost associated with the labeling process thus may render large, fully labeled training sets infeasible, whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive.  In such situations, semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value.  However, training the model only on a small amount of labeled data will lead to a weak model, we therefore propose a deep learning model for label annotation and image segmentation.
