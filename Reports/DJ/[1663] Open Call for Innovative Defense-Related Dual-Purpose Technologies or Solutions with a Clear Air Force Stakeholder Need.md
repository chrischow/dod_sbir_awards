Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need

# Abstract


Many recent publications have detailed the rising threat that Chinese dominance of the Artificial Intelligence space poses to the national security of the United States. While many would shout that the sky is falling, VSMerlot, LLC offers a unique and immediate solution--Dtangleâ„¢. Dtangleâ„¢ creates a complexity reduction architecture that allows an AI solution to restructure its guiding rules (code) on the fly. This is considered the â€œHoly Grailâ€ of AI. Current approaches to this technology mimic this behavior by creating copies of the original code from the ground up and replacing the original code with the best version. Dtangleâ„¢ simply rewrites itself. The result is code with an 80% reduction in complexity with 100% error tracing capability. Our developers have successfully tested the technology through internal test applications. We are now looking for real-world problems that allow a demonstration of this technology. We are in multiple conversations with commercial entities regarding pilot projects. The AFWERX SBIR program is an additional avenue for these efforts.
