Sentient Autonomous Maintainer (SAM) for Marine Diesel Engines
==============================================================

# Abstract


MSI will collaborate with various diesel engine manufacturers to create a Sentient Autonomous Maintainer (SAM) for remote diagnostics, prognostics, and self-maintenance of marine diesel engines for use on Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). This SAM will monitor the engine¡_s current state, predict the engine¡_s future state, automatically correct conditions when possible, and report impending or current failures to the remote controller. The SAM will make use of Bayesian based artificial intelligence algorithms to operate as an automated Prognostic Health Management (PHM) system. The PHM system will collect and fuse operations data with performance data and then use Physics of Failure models to 1) estimate the state of sensored and hidden conditions, 2) predict time to transition to future failure states, 3) estimate the degree (probability) of safety and economic risk in the predictions, and 4) provide accurate decision support. PHM has been shown to be valuable in providing advanced warning of conditions that lead to failure of expensive weapon systems so that Condition Based Maintenance can be performed in a timely and effective manner.
