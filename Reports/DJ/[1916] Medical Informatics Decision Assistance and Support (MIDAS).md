===========================================================

# Abstract


The objective of the Medical Informatics Decision Assistance and Support (MIDAS) project is to research, develop, and design a capability for sensing, addressing, and acting to combat the musculoskeletal injury epidemic facing Navy and Marine Corps personnel. The MIDAS technical solution outlined in this Phase II SBIR proposal will make relevant physical training observations and contextual information accessible to humans and machines as a knowledge graph; apply machine learning, reasoning, and semantics to assert a Musculoskeletal Injury Risk Score (MIRS) that leverages contextual knowledge, such as personnel activity, demographic data, and unit training requirements; enable USMC Force Fitness personnel and trainers to improve individual and unit injury prevention by providing dynamic training injury risk assessments; alert and quickly modify user behavior (athletic, active duty assignment, etc.) based on observed metrics (situational awareness); and enhance timely and open communication between military unit personnel through dynamic performance monitoring, messaging, and easy to understand user interfaces. The outcomes of Phase I set the stage to research, develop, and demonstrate a full scale prototype MIDAS knowledge graph and analytics engine that targets and utilizes USMC training system concepts and resources to predict and mitigate the effects of musculoskeletal injuries.
