Integrated Data Registration for Networked Aircraft
===================================================

# Abstract


A prototype integrated data registration solution using machine learning algorithm(s) is proposed. The solution will improve upon existing sensor and data registration solutions by implementing internal models capable of adapting to highly variable operating environments. The prototype will demonstrate IDR capability in a relevant laboratory environment using actual E-2 flight data where truth is known. Feedback from this demonstration will be incorporated into subsequent prototype development, culminating in a demonstration where the prototype is integrated with E-2 systems in a hardware in the loop laboratory. Performance of the prototype will be measured in terms of improved kinematic accuracy of a number of selected contacts of interest against a known performance baseline.
