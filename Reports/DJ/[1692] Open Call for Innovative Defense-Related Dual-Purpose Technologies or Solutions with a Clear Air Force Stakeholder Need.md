Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The US Air Forceâ€™s strategic programs are under increased scrutiny because of underperformance to contracted terms. These challenges are not unique to the Air Force or to the larger Department of Defense. Globally 70% of defense programs fail to meet original contracted terms. Supply chains constitute a well-documented risk challenging programs in meeting contracted terms. Our proposed solution to the challenge of supply chain risk is a tool bringing together industry verified techniques for what Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman calls â€œThe single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methodsâ€, (Reference Class Forecasting) in his bestseller â€œThinking Fast and Slowâ€, with state of the art Artificial Intelligence capability. Both the Reference Class Forecasting and Artificial Intelligence elements of our proposed solution are currently being used in the non-defense commercial industry. Given the ubiquitous challenge of supply chain risk across the business world, we assess a strong proliferation potential for the proposed solution into the foreseeable future, with the US Air Force, larger Department of Defense, and other US government agencies potentially benefitting from investment and economies of scale.
