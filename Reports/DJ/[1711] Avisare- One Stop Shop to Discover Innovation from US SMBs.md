==========================================================

# Abstract


The Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Air Force (USAF) follow DoD Instruction 5000.02, “Operation of the Defense Acquisition System,” which governs procurement of weapon systems, services, and Automated Information Systems (AIS). DoD 5000.02 also categorizes the specific mandatory reports (statutory and regulatory) and other information necessary for program milestones and decision points. The instruction is published by the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Acquisition and Logistics (A&L). The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process defines acquisition requirements and evaluation criteria for future defense programs. JCIDS was created to replace previous service-specific requirements generation systems that created redundancies in capabilities and failed to meet the joint needs of all the services. The Air Force acquisition system is led by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics (AT&L), which follow the USAF Acquisition Process Model (APM), Published Version 10.1 dated November 18, 2019. In addition to the DoD and USAF acquisition model, there are a multitude of other Federal Government procurement organizations, such as the General Services Administration (GSA) with countless contracting vehicles, Government wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, etc. The net result is an overly complicated system that taxes the resources of prospective industry contract performers and is an even deeper burden to the small business community who might not have the infrastructure, skillsets, or expertise to be successful within the government acquisition process. The fragmented, decentralized procurement systems have separate funding streams that are disconnected, certiﬁcations that are cumbersome and confusing for people to navigate, and a countless number of small businesses are left wanting. Inefficiencies within the sourcing process also limits the number and quality of the bids, resulting in: A mountain of paperwork. Having to research supplier information. Slow procurement processes and bottlenecks that take a long time to get through. Waiting for compliance reports. Manual information collection. Complaints from the small business community who are left out. Issues with NAICS numbering system. Because the landscape is so overwhelmingly difficult, it is hard for everyone to navigate (buyers, procurement staff and suppliers alike). To address these issues, Avisare has developed a Software-as-a-Service platform for the contracting and small business ecosystem. This Technology Readiness Level (TRL) -8 system is designed for easy off-the-shelf use. It allows a network of suppliers to communicate and collaborate. With built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI), user-friendly user interfaces, and functionality that supports collaboration, Avisare is the first of its kind launching this new capability.
