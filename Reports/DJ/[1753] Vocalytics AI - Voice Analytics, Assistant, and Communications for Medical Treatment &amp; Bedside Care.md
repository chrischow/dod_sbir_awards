======================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Vocalytics AI team believes advancing the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our battlefield decision making and warfighting capabilities is critical to our national security.  Our opinion is it is through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) unlock the true potential of AI will be assembled. Our proprietary 3D audio specialization algorithms leverage beamforming, echo & noise cancellation, speaker detection, and several compatible auxiliary voice technologies.  We leverage automatic speech recognition (ASR) for transcription of the conversation, then surface insights with NLP and NLU.  Our API’s and webhooks can integrate with existing environments and trigger notifications based on predetermined events. Vocalytics AI enables organizations the unique ability to extract deep, actionable insights from every interaction enabling a pulse on the health of the operations.  Vocalytics AI Acoustic Models are trained and tuned to perform efficiently for each environment, allowing extraction of deep conversational insights: Sentiment, Tonality, Intonation of operators help passively measure satisfaction & engagement.  (mood of interaction) Detect Keywords & Key Phrases relating to operations, deployed forces, and disseminate affinity with each side of the interaction. Business Cases around service recovery situations, operational efficiency, linguistic standards, consistent messaging, and others. Operational Command Dashboard Analysis with powerful reporting for operational efficiency, compliance, and consistent communication standards.
