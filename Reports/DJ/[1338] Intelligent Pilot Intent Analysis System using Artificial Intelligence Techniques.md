Intelligent Pilot Intent Analysis System using Artificial Intelligence Techniques
=================================================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve the ability of onboard software to predict trajectories of other aircraft in the terminal area of operations.  This ability can only be realized with an automatic capability for recognizing the intent of the pilots of these other aircraft in the complex and dynamic terminal area.  The Phase I prototype absolutely proved the feasibility of using procedure and dialog graphs, fractional dialog grammars and Behavior Transition Networks for ground trajectory prediction, by actually implementing them in software and demonstrating them with actual air traffic control transcripts and simulated sensor data.    The next logical step, as addressed by this proposal, is to develop the full-scale Intelligent Pilot Intent Analysis System (IPIAS) to support autonomous UAV ground operations and integrate it to the degree possible with the appropriate UAV systems currently being developed.  The Phase II IPIAS will analyze text recognized from actual airport ATC-Pilot communications and simulated sensor data to predict routes on the ground for aircraft on the ground, taking off, and landing.  We will coordinate with sibling contractors and the selected prime through early and frequent contact to ensure full understanding of the evolving requirements, constraints, opportunities, and integration issues.     BENEFIT:  The direct target for this effort is UASs operating in the terminal area of operations (TAO).  The primary commercialization plan for IPIAS relative to this domain will be to demonstrate a significant potential for automatic, intelligent pilot intent recognition, thus improving safety related to UASs in the TAO with reduced manning in Phase II.  This will allow us to acquire Phase III funding to transition IPIAS to operational use.  The realization of this capability will create a demand for similar systems for other agencies (i.e. the Army, Navy, and Marines) since they all have UASs.  Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Agency have the similar problem of a growing number of UASs, and the desire to operate them in the TAO.
