A Biopsychosocial Approach to Real-Time Health Monitoring for Performance Optimization of ISR Operators
=======================================================================================================

# Abstract


Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) workflows do not effectively or comprehensively consider the potentially negative impacts of physical and cognitive degradation on human analystsâ€™ performance. This is particularly true when analysts experience negative effects from fatigue or burnout, which they are unlikely to self-report. Occupational stress can impact quality-of- life, physiological function, and is associated with alteration in performance. S.A.Wyze has developed a biosensor platform that is well-suited to achieving this goal. S.A.Wyze will develop a specific product form that uses a Biopsychosocial Approach to Real-Time Health Monitoring for early detection of physical and cognitive degradation in ISR operators. This secured solution will utilize novel integrated technologies to create a holistic, personalized profile that includes physiological data from novel on-body biosensors, environmental and psychological data from mobile application inputs, social behavior data from social media accounts that feeds into cloud-based artificial intelligence engine.
