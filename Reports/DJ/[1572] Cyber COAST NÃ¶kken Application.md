Cyber COAST NÃ¶kken Application
===============================

# Abstract


In order to improve the efficiency of the Mission Data File lifecycle, we propose building an tailored JSF application on top of an advanced commercially available data integration platform. The application will be called Cyber COAST NÃ¶kken and will contain the tailored code, algorithms, methods, and processes used to fully leverage the advanced analytic platform for the JSF Mission Data File (MDF) mission. Through NÃ¶kken, Cyber COAST will integrate advanced data science, ML, and AI capabilities to improve JSFâ€™s data fusion, data management, and integration of disparate data sources and augment them with advanced machine learning and geospatial capabilities.
