# Abstract


Today's information landscape contains a wide range of data sources and types that are vast and rapidly changing. The tsunami of data available for analysis and decision making requires an automated, flexible, scalable Data Ingestion Framework to handle data movement, collection, and transformation needed to support advanced analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Our codeless metadata-driven framework greatly reduces the timeline for data acquisition to ensure speed to market while remaining, flexible, scalable, extendable, and customizable.Â
