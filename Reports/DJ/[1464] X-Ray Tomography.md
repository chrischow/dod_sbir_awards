# Abstract


CSLabs develops XDLayer (â€œX-ray DeLayerâ€�) as an automated software framework to non-destructively analyze Printed Circuit Boards (PCB's) using lab x-ray microscope systems. XDLayer performs automated sample scanning with optimized 2D and 3D image analysis algorithms to maximize overall system throughput by minimizing the number of viewing angles and exposure times needed to analyze a given PCB, while scanning feedback and image analysis of the PCB during acquisition ensures high quality reconstruction. XDLayer forms the basis of a scalable, extensible platform for reverse engineering, failure analysis, and change detection (Trust) of PCBs. Trade space parameter optimization based on rigorous physics-based simulation enables comprehensive XDLayer algorithm development, including image-stitching, limited-view computed tomography, and 3D segmentation and classification for PCB structures. Key innovations in XDLayer technologies allow optimization across the processing chain, combining iterative computed tomography methods with machine learning driven classification and segmentation methods, using as priors, the expected structures of PCBs such as planar wiring, and multi-class density classifications. These optimizations enable high quality PCB reconstruction while reducing analysis times compared with conventional computed tomography algorithms, managing high density materials on flux-limited microscope systems.
