Machine Learning for Defense Applications
=========================================

# Abstract


Polaris Sensor Technologies, Inc., presents a program plan (focused on the Phase 1 effort) to address the penultimate goal of â€œcoloring the good guys blue and the bad guys redâ€� using multi-mode aerial imagery of ground targets in the visible and thermal IR coupled with the most advanced Continuous Machine Learning (CML) approaches, techniques, and architectures. CML has many computational and operational advantages that allow it to address future challenges. By coupling CML with multi-mode, multi-waveband imagery, Polaris offers a unique approach to advance warfighter capability by reducing crew workload by taking advantage of existing sensor capability.
