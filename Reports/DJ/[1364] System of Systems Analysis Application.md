# Abstract


ABSTRACT: In Phase I, Advances in graph computing and data analytics are leveraged to demonstrate techniques for analyzing interactions among independent systems understanding emergent behaviors in SoS (e.g., agent based simulation). The focus is on integration of software tools to create an environment testbed for A2AD that allows for holistic and contiguous connection of data nodes, edges and architectural layers. The environment testbed enables modeling-simulation-analysis-looping through executable simulations of a mission model defined by mission threads. Iterations of the executable software graph allow for advanced data analytics on the resulting data and engineering of architectures and mission thread scenarios. The expected result extends prevailing systems modeling and simulation methods to new constructs where models are synchronized with real world behavior then executed in simulations where big data techniques allow for characterization and quantification of performance, risk, and desired boundary conditions. The process extends across the system lifecycle and puts engineering back into systems engineering.; BENEFIT: The proposed System of Systems Analysis Application (SoSAA) allows for interrogation of the complex data interactions and results in performance measures of static models through executable simulations; engineering data analytics provides stakeholders with quantifiable information about architectures and their intended mission(s); assess collective and individual mission thread Ps and select best architectures for meeting mission goals. Decide on architecture performance before costly development investments, Energy, epidemiology, transportation and global enterprises where modeling and simulation are used in a connected world are potential commercial applications.
