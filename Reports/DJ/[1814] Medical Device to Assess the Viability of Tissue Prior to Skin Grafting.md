Medical Device to Assess the Viability of Tissue Prior to Skin Grafting
=======================================================================

# Abstract


The primary objective of this proposal is to design and demonstrate the SpectralMD DeepView imaging technology can allow surgeons to quickly and objectively assess the viability of tissue in a burn excision site prior to skin grafting. DeepView uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data acquired by multispectral imaging to generate quantitative prognostic images with a user-friendly output that is easily interpretable. It is to our knowledge the only burn imaging technology that has undergone thorough investigation in a pre-clinical animal model of burn excision, where it demonstrated success in detecting tissue viability throughout the skin layers and into the subcutaneous fat.  Upon completion of this project, a portable DeepView system will be designed that provides images of the post-excisional remaining tissues in real-time to aid surgeons in determining if and how much burn tissue to excise. Other uses of the portable DeepView device include: diagnosing burn wound healing potential and the need for surgery during in burn triage; determining proper level of limb amputation to minimize the high rate of re-amputation in the chronic wound population; and monitoring of reconstructive flap viability. The portable DeepView system will have wide commercial utility in addition to the current military-focused application.
