Medical Informatics Decision Assistance and Support (MIDAS)
===========================================================

# Abstract


This proposal for a SBIR Phase II to develop a new system for Medical Informatics Decision Assistance and Support (MIDAS). The proposed effort is a closely coordinated collaboration between Perceptronics Solutions, Inc. as prime contractor and Charles River Analytics (CRA) as subcontractor. Our overall objective is to improve Navy patient care and outcomes via an integrated MIDAS system that will provide solutions for two sets of critical problems: (1) Perceptronics Solutions mobile Assisted Informatics and Decision Support for Medics (AID-Medic) will address information overload and training needs for Navy hospital corpsmen and civilian paramedics; and (2) Charles River Analytics system for Reworking Visualizations and Analytics for Medical Information (REVAMP) will provide more efficient and effective use of medical data in military and civilian hospitals. The Perceptronics Solutions team includes consultants Dr. Ross Donaldson, developer of the WikEM online emergency medicine database, and Dr. William Rand, a specialist in the use of Artificial Intelligence to extract information from large data bases. The Charles River Analytics team includes MedStar Health, the largest healthcare provider in Maryland and the Washington, D.C. region. Our Phase II technical approach is based on the successful results of our teams individual AID-Medic and REVAMP Phase I projects
