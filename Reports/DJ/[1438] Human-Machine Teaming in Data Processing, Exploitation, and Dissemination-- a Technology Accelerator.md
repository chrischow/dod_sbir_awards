Human-Machine Teaming in Data Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination-- a Technology Accelerator
====================================================================================================

# Abstract


Cognovi Labsâ€™ Artificial Intelligence technology offers solutions that would result in: 1.) a reduction in Air Force analyst fatigue by aggregating very large unstructured data sets; 2.) analyzing and distilling the data in a variety of ways that will result in a potentially significant decrease in the time from data receipt to actionable intelligence; and 3.) a more streamlined presentation of the findings of such analysis and increased product interpretability. The potential use cases for our technology are extensive, but we Phase 1 opportunities for Cognoviâ€™s Artificial Intelligence technology to help human ISR analysts better aggregate, extract, and succinctly present sentiment, emotional engagement and/or motivation, as well as highly relevant topics of discussion -- in real-time -- using either the myriad of unstructured data sets the ISR analysts view every day. Importantly, we believe Cognovi AIâ€™s proprietary psychological framework will allow ISR analysts to better anticipate future human behaviors based on their various data sets.
