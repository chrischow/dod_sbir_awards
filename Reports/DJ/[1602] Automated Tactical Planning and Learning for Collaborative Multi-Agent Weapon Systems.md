Automated Tactical Planning and Learning for Collaborative Multi-Agent Weapon Systems
=====================================================================================

# Abstract


In this context, we propose an Artificial Intelligence tactical mission coordination and planning system with diable autonomy human interface. An artificial intelligence tactical mission planner will generate single or multi-robot (or other manned or unmanned asset) strategies (action plans, navigation waypoints) by considering overall missions goals and constraints, such as: target location distribution, required execution time and capabilities of available assets. The system will prioritize targets to generate a sequence for engagement and propose the operator with an action plan and suitable collaborative weapons playbook scripts. The operator is the final decision maker who decides if to continue or adjust with the suggested strategies.
