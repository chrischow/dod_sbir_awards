Reconfigurable Quantum Entanglement Distribution Network
========================================================

# Abstract


Phase I will couple the entangled pair sources to the existing University of ArizonaÂ network for distribution, to deploy single photon array detectors, and also to add a free space leg to the network using adaptive optics. Simulations of the University of Arizona multi-node quantum fiber and free space network will be used to analyze concepts, and machine learning will be used to design efficient communication and adaptive optics protocols.
