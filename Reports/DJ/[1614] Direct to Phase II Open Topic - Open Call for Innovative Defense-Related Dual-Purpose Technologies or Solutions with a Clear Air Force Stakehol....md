Direct to Phase II Open Topic: Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
===================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The US Air Force has a goal to increase efficiency and accuracy of its current flight scheduling process. This initiative addresses multiple stakeholders across the Squadron and Wing who can all benefit from a better performing, agile and more accurate scheduling system. A system that helps automate some of the logical dependencies needed to create a flight schedule would alleviate a significant burden that is currently being fielded by active duty personnel trained for more important roles. Stardog proposes an artificially intelligent Knowledge Graph platform to link data across multiple different datasets currently required to schedule flights. Our team is proposing the Stardog Knowledge Graph Platform as a Dual Purpose Technology to AFSOC Alison Group and the 22d Airlift Squadron who are motivated to modernize their approach to data access and analysis across disparate data sources for the purposes of flight scheduling. Stardog provides a standards-based software platform that pulls data together from multiple data sources for unifying information required by stakeholders. By using a knowledge graph, knowledge about the flight scheduling domain itself, the processes of the squadron, the personnel dependencies needed, and all referenced data can be seen together through a unified, connected data dashboard.
