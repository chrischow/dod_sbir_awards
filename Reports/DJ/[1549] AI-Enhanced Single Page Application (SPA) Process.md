AI-Enhanced Single Page Application (SPA) Process
=================================================

# Abstract


Our Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced Single Page Application (SPA) Process, which leverages our POM Tool(TM), is available TODAY to benefit the Air Force as an enterprise class solution without the enterprise Information Technology (IT) budget. It reduces the risks and inefficiencies inherent in emailing/maintaining files on user machines, whereby offline Excel-based processes are easily modeled into standardized documents for collaborative file sharing. It creates an in memory, user friendly, drag-and-drop environment with real-time access to the most accurate and current data, capable of reading over 500 spreadsheets yet performing as one.
