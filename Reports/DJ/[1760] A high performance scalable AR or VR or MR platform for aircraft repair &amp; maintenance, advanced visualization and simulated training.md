A high performance scalable AR/VR/MR platform for aircraft repair &amp; maintenance, advanced visualization and simulated training
==================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The state-of-the-art AR/VR/MR systems today suffer from limited compute capability, battery capacity and very restrictive thermal envelope, severely limiting the effectiveness of integrated immersive experiences, and these challenges will persist in the foreseeable future. GridRaster overcomes these challenges by providing the underlying compute and network stack to power immersive mixed-reality experiences on mobile platforms by off-loading the heavy computation to dedicated servers and streaming the experience to the device wirelessly.  GridRaster provides the software infrastructure to power high-quality immersive mixed-reality (MR) applications for enterprise customers. Its high-performance scalable Augmented-, Virtual- and Mixed-Realities (AR/VR/MR) cloud platform is powered by distributed edge computing, low-latency remote rendering and 3D Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Spatial Mapping. The platform provides a seamless API-based integration with existing content formats and devices making it truly cross-platform solution that fits into the current content ecosystem of our customers. GridRaster has built the product working with select large enterprise customers in aerospace, automotive, and telecommunications.
