A Dynamically Re-taskable, Global System for Persistent Ground ISR
==================================================================

# Abstract


U.S. Air Force (USAF) components of Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAFRICA), in conjunction with Naval Special Warfare (NSW) elements, require a next-generation intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability to enable remote and dynamically re-taskable ground access to operational environments (OEs) in support of high-consequence, counter-violent extremist organization (VEO) missions. Using data science and machine learning (ML), Premiseâ€™s objective is to address critical SOCAFRICA requirements with an exponentially-expanding, global network of more than 600,000 human data contributors to enable massively-scalable, virtual collection across the African continent (directed observations, associated sentiment, and wireless network mapping). Premiseâ€™s technology manages and validates (via ML modules) contributor submissions through a mobile app and digital task marketplace (a micro-payment system that ensures low response latency).
