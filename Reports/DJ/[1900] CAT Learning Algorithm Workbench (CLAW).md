CAT Learning Algorithm Workbench (CLAW)
=======================================

# Abstract


Current countermeasure anti-torpedo (CAT) systems use explicit logic to direct single-target intercepts resulting in an inability to adapt to the complexities of the stochastic marine environment and the problems of multiple, simultaneous threats. The CAT Learning Algorithm Workbench (CLAW) is an analytical research testbed capable of comparing the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to optimize and automate anti-torpedo fire control against multiple targets. By applying recent developments in intelligent algorithms to existing simulations and models in the program of record using an instrumented test environment, investigators can identify the most promising design for using adaptive learning in the Torpedo Warning System. The benefit of the approach is to harden battle group defenses against torpedo salvos by finding optimal fire control solutions and automating the launch decision process.
