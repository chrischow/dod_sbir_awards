Augmentir- 1st Artificial Intelligence-based Connected Worker Platform
======================================================================

# Abstract


Augmentir’s Connected Worker Platform (ACWP)  is the first Artificial Intelligence-based Connected Worker Platform that helps empower service and manufacturing workers to perform their jobs with higher quality and increased productivity while driving continuous improvement across the organization. The platform provides a unique approach to authoring and running augmented, step-by-step work procedures that not only guide workers through their tasks more effectively but also enables organizations to non-intrusively capture data on how tasks are being performed. Augmentir’s embedded AI engine uses that data to develop unique insights that help organizations quickly identify where opportunities for improvement exist. From service to assembly instructions to training, certification, compliance documentation, and quality assurance, Augmentir provides transformational value across a range of industrial use cases.  Using ACWP, USAF maintainers will be able to improve productivity and quality through the use of personalized, proficiency-based work procedures that guide workers with contextual information, thus improving overall worker effectiveness. It also promotes Knowledge Sharing by creating a centralized mindshare and building a knowledge-base for training and organizational improvement. Quality Assurance (QA) and Compliance checkpoints are an extremely important aspect of aviation maintenance. Our ACWP enables digital QA signoffs, data capture, and an automatically generated audit trail. Augmentir delivers more effective training with in-line and last-minute training that fills knowledge gaps and results in better retention. AI-based recommendations improve overall maintenance effectiveness. The use of ACWP drives and accelerates organization-wide continuous improvement and supports digital transformation of the organization and activities associated with maintainers’ duties and responsibilities.  Use Case studies with current ACWP users, STRONGARM, BioChem and HOLT-CAT have produced extremely positive results. As an example, BioChem concluded that “Augmentir has made our complex procedures very repeatable for operators of all skill levels. As a result, our training time for new operators has been reduced by over 80%.” STRONGARM cited a direct, observable benefit: “We lost a senior technician but ACWP was able to upskill a junior person to avoid missing shipments”  The ACWP's AI engine, cleanses, pipelines and labels all operational data and automatically delivers the following outcomes: 1) Proficiency ratings on all tasks performed be every worker - enabling us to deliver instructions that are matched to the capability of each worker 2) Stack Ranked list of the largest capturable productivity opportunities across the organization and insights on how to capture them 3) Training Insights - identifying what training opportunities will produce the highest productivity impact.  These enable the most productive workforce and one that improves over time.
