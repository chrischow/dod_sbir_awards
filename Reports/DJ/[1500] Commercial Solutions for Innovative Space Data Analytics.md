# Abstract


RBC Signals would utilize the placements of AWS Outposts, Microsoft Azure Stack, and VMWare virtual servers with storage in our network of ground stations. This would create an environment where the USAF could process data with advanced applications (big data/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) within the ground station. The necessary computing infrastructure including processing, storage, networking and security would be built into the ground stations. As data landed from satellites, the data could immediately be processed by advanced data analytic applications securely.
