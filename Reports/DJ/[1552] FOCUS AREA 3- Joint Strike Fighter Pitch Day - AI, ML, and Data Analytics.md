FOCUS AREA 3- Joint Strike Fighter Pitch Day: AI, ML, and Data Analytics
========================================================================

# Abstract


The C3 Platform is a proven, scalable, and production-ready commercial enterprise software platform for developing and operating big data, predictive and prescriptive analytics, and IoT use cases including predictive maintenance, logistics and potential applicability to multi-domain command & control (MDC2). The C3 Platform uses a unique technology-independent model-driven architecture pervasive across data ingress, processing, persistence, AI-machine learning analytics and secure egress to accelerate development and deployment of mission-critical applications. C3 personnel deploy these C3 Applications in short timeframes at lower cost to demonstrate proven value in weeks, not years. Low-cost, low-risk prototypes of C3 Solutions allow organizations to validate the mission and economic value to their organization before expanding into full production use.
