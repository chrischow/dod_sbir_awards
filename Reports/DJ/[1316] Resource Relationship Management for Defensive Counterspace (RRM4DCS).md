Resource Relationship Management for Defensive Counterspace (RRM4DCS)
=====================================================================

# Abstract


Effective defensive counterspace (DCS) begins with the ability to maintain space situational awareness (SSA). The detection and discrimination of spacecraft events has moved from low-level alarms, to the application of data fusion (DF) across multiple levels, and most recently, to the use of resource management (RM) to complement data fusion and translate operational requirements into responses for satellites, ground stations, and links to warfighters. There are severe complexities in managing a large number of resources supporting several concurrent missions across commands. To assist JSpOC operators with Level 2 Resource Management, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of decision-aids and automated algorithms for Resource Relationship Management for Defensive Counterspace (RRM4DCS). Our approach is founded on the Dual Node Network (DNN) Data Fusion & Resource Management (DF&RM) architecture and extends our current research in Level 2 and Level 3 data fusion as a member of the AFRL/RV Data Fusion Research Team to Level 2 resource management within the JSARS program. Our proposed approach features the formulation of a resource relationships ontology, an analysis of alternatives of optimization approaches, the design of a level 2 RM node network, and refinement of existing Level 2 Data Fusion to support resource relationships management.   BENEFIT: These decision-aids and automated algorithms developed under this effort will enable operators to reduce the time required for generating responses and increase the quality of appropriate response actions for defensive counterspace operations. We see direct application of the proposed effort to the JSpOC via the JSpOC Situational Assessment and Response System (JSARS), Situation Awareness Fusion Integrated Research Environment (SAFIRE), Space C2, ISSA, and Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting Systems (RAIDRS) programs. In addition, the proposed effort will drive the development of our EAToolkitTM commercial product, an evolutionary algorithm software development kit for optimization and machine learning.
