Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The amount of data being generated in a wide range of industries continues to grow exponentially, and yet the tools to analyze that data have not kept pace. Decision-makers need a way to derive actionable insights from these large data sets without having to commit additional human resources. infoSentience has developed a system of tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) and a Natural Language Generator (NLG) to analyze any large complicated data set, determine what events within the data are most relevant to a given end user, and then provide a natural language report on its findings. The solution is capable of generating reports ranging from a paragraph to many pages in length. These reports can be based on any type of structured data and can cover any topic. The narrative can include information on trends, outlier events, critical changes, and other pertinent information, all with appropriate context to help the decision-maker understand why the changes took place. infoSentience plans to work with potential Air Force end-users to identify areas where infoSentience can apply its technology to provide accurate, instantly available data analysis.
