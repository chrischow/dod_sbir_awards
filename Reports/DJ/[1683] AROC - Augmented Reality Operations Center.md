AROC: Augmented Reality Operations Center
=========================================

# Abstract


BadVR's augmented reality operations center (AROC) platform transforms data analytics into an interactive visual experience that increase the effectiveness of decision-making during high-stress scenarios.  Traditional analytics methods like charts, graphs, and spreadsheets require dedicated focus and extensive technical training to operationalize.  With our innovation, immersion lowers the cognitive load and creates a shared context for collaboration, increasing engagement and retention during mission activities.  In short, we make data more accessible. Based on patent-pending edge computing algorithms, the AROC platform has no cloud computing dependencies, which means it can run on-prem, offline, or even within classified environments.  Users start by connecting live or historical datasets, then selecting from several task-driven standard ‘data environments’, and finally stepping inside their data using an AR/VR headset or compatible smartphone.  From within, they can interact using natural hand gestures and invite others to collaborate in real-time.  The system has operated within the commercial sector for over 12 months and has been shown to increase the amount of data within view by 10-100X when compared to traditional 2D methods.
