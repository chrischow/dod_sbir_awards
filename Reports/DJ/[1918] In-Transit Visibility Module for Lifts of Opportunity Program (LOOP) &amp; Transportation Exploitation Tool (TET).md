In-Transit Visibility Module for Lifts of Opportunity Program (LOOP) &amp; Transportation Exploitation Tool (TET)
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


While supporting critical operations, service members need the confidence to know when their assets will arrive. Too often, when our countrymen are deployed, they are left guessing when and where their stuff is located. This makes it near impossible to adequately plan a mission, when the commander cannot be sure that they will be able to deliver a capability. The Transportation Exploitation Tool (TET) and Lifts of Opportunity (LOOP) applications look to bridge that gap by providing Sailors and Marines the ability to accurately and easily find connecting flights; however, those technologies are still at the mercy of the cargo while it is in transit. Of benefit to applications like TET or LOOP would be to know in advance what will require action. Tactical Edge is proud to propose a solution that will consume data from multiple authoritative data systems, identify relationships between that data, understand current location, apply rules and machine learning algorithms to predict arrival both prior to and during shipment, and provide a notification backbone with the ability to alert stakeholders with enough notice to expedite a late shipment or plan for alternative solutions with the intent to minimize impact to the warfighter.
