Automatic User Interface Configuration Management
=================================================

# Abstract


During Phase I of this SBIR effort, Anacapa Sciences, Inc. invented a new technology for analyzing and optimizing the design of critical aspects of the User Interfaces (UIs) for real-time systems that have high urgency for errorless operator performance. The technology is based on machine-learning algorithms currently used in commercial data mining applications. We discovered that this class of algorithms – a form of artificial intelligence – could be employed to analyze UI design data from historical and currently-deployed systems, to develop a mathematical knowledgebase. This knowledgebase comprises equations that quantify the successes and failures of UI designs in their support of critical aspects of user performance. Information in these equations can be used to prescribe new [or upgraded] UI design features and functions that will optimally support such critical performance.
