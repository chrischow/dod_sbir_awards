# Abstract


R-Check SCA has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of testing several of the most difficult compliance requirements for SCA certification. This Phase II.5 effort extends the advantages of R-Check SCA testing in three ways. First, this effort updates existing support for SCA 4.0 to SCA 4.1 and incorporates testing support for additional SCA 4.1 requirements. Second, this effort will enable R-Check SCA to support waveform and operating environment codes developed using the 2011 extensions to the C++ programming language (C++11). Third, this effort will incorporate techniques from unsupervised machine learning to cluster and sort remaining manual source code inspection tasks with the goal of reducing test engineer context-switch overhead during the inspection process.
