# Abstract


Adluminâ€™s cybersecurity analytics platform is a high performance architecture integrating serverless routines, messaging queues, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, relational, non-relational, event stream databases, analytic processing, and a robust API infrastructure. Essentially automating all the routine work of cybersecurity that would take thousands of humans to do effectively. Today, Airmen in the cybersecurity career field are currently tasked with monitoring about 1,000 uses each which require a huge cognitive burden and countless man hours. Adlumin is the solution to those costly, time consuming, and error prone tasks. Adlumin allows high demand/low-density resources, such as cybersecurity Airmen, to focus on mitigation and cyber defense.
