Pitch Day for F-35 Lightning II Data Tools
==========================================

# Abstract


The Securboration team has developed a micro service framework, Genesis, leveraging Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to provide automated updates to entity records and related system models for DIAâ€™s Machine Assisted Rapid-Repository System (MARS). This core technology will be extended to include Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) to feed the F-35â€™s Mission Data File (MDF) production processes. The objective of Genesis-IMD is to increase the speed, effectiveness, and quality of IMD and subsequent MDFs for F-35 operations by providing automated updates, when able, or identification of critical threat parametric data requiring analyst intervention. Securboration is currently commercializing several of the micro-services to be used in Genesis-IMD for other customers (e.g. DIAâ€™s MARS program), which will buy down risk for the government. This phase one effort will focus on determining the best AF end-users (e.g. NASIC IMD producers and 53rd Electronic Warfare Group IMD consumers/MDF producers) for transition to Phase II and then Phase III with the F-35 JPO, DIA MARS, or a related Program of Record.
