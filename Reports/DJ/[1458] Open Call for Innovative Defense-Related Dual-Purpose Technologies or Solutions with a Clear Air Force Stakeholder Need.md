Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Building autonomous systems â€“ from robots and drones to self-driving vehicles â€“ is a data intensive process. Training machine learning models, evaluating the performance of various algorithms, and resolving errors and edge cases all require capturing, organizing and accessing massive datasets which frequently reach petabyte scale. The Raven[Ops] Robotic Data Management System (RDMS) provides off-the-shelf data management infrastructure for the entire robotic perception data lifecycle with the goal of speeding up autonomous systems development.
