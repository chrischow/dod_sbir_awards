Tactical Artificial Intelligence Toolkit for Battlefield Airmen
===============================================================

# Abstract


Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have led to significant advancements in the ability for computers to augment operators ability to rapidly draw conclusions from geospatial imagery. Slingshot Aerospace believes that AI enriched geospatial imagery on an ATAK device represents an enormous opportunity to transform the way Special Tactics Operators perform their unique mission sets by enhancing their ability to provide timely tactical situational awareness in support of the JFC or JSOTF Commander. For phase 1, Slingshot Aerospace will apply its expertise in advanced data analytics to assess the feasibility of providing a rapid and automated strike assessment streamed directly to an ATAK device. Beyond Phase I, the final implementation of this proposed technology will enable near-real time strike assessments and other automated object and feature extractions eliminating the need for lengthy human-in-the-loop analysis and use of unknowing crowd-sourced microworkers.
