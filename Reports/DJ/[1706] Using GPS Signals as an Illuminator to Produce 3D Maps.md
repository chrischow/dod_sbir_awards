Using GPS Signals as an Illuminator to Produce 3D Maps
======================================================

# Abstract


Hypergiant Galactic Systems  is developing a new technique for high resolution earth imaging.  GPS satellites “illuminate” the earth with radio signals that bounce off the planet.  Our CubeSats detect these signals as if they were a kind of radar.  We call this WIDAR.  WIDAR consists of two primary components.  First, our CubeSats detect reflected GPS signals, which are sent to a ground station that uses Artificial Intelligence to produce high quality, 3D pictures of the earth with 1 meter resolution.  Since GPS is global, WIDAR can be made global.  Second, at the ground station, images are constructed from these GPS reflections.  We can also potentially see into building structures, underground, below water and other places not currently accessible from space.
