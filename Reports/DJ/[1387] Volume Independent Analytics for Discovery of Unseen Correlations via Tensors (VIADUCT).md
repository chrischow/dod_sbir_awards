Volume Independent Analytics for Discovery of Unseen Correlations via Tensors (VIADUCT)
=======================================================================================

# Abstract


This Phase II effort continues development of Volume Independent Analytics for Discovery of Unseen Correlations via Tensors (VIADUCT). VIADUCT leverages recent advances in tensor decompositions as a form of unsupervised discovery and the proliferation of open source Big Data tools to address the lack of advanced analytics available to Air Force Activity Based Intelligence (ABI) analysts. This effort extends VIADUCT with (1) support for more precision tensor decomposition methods and improved tensor construction tools, (2) improved performance and scalability to open Big Data platforms, tools, and data storage standards, and (3) automated post-processing support for ranking and identifying activities of interest. With these enhancements, VIADUCT will provide an automated machine learning capability for discovering previously unknown patterns-of-life and patterns-of-activity in billion- to trillion scale multi-INT datasets.
