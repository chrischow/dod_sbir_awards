Prevention of Corrosion for Navy Aviation
=========================================

# Abstract


There is a tremendous need to identify and optimize the factors that affect human performance in maintenance and inspection. Innovative solutions that highlight and track corrosion issues are required in order to enhance the maintainerâ€™s ability in the prevention, inspection, removal and treatment of corrosion and information management. This proposal describes an approach utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Statistical methods that the authors have successfully utilized in predicting the deterioration of Navy ship tank and void services and Army/ Marine Corp wheeled vehicles. In addition, the methods we created for aircraft inspection and data mining of the resulting depot level scoring, induction inspections and maintenance for the Navy and Air Force will also be used in the development of an Aircraft Corrosion Prediction and Simulation software tool. This tool will predict and display the corrosion hotspots on the aircraft as they evolve. The proposed technology should result in substantial decreases in maintenance costs associated with detecting, repairing, and tracking corrosive areas.
