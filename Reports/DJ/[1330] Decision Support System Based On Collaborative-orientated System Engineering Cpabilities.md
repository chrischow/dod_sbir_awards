Decision Support System Based On Collaborative-orientated System Engineering Cpabilities
========================================================================================

# Abstract


While current Air Force logistics processes have served us well, and provided unparalleled support since the end of the Cold War, the need to significantly reduce costs while improving weapons system availability is essential.  Senior Air Force officials have stated in numerous documents that the Air Force has reached a point where its current way of doing supply chain management (SCM) business, and the systems that support the current process, are limited in their ability to significantly improve readiness beyond the current levels.  As such, the Air Force is pursuing continuous improvement as the engine that drives transformation.  Significant change in sustainment support to the warfighter is a key component in the overall transformation initiatives being pursued by Air Force Material Command.  The lack of a comprehensive, technology transition decision support system to standardize reverse engineering, technology insertion, and technology redesign are critical areas of investigation.  Cognition LLC will develop and deliver a framework to aid in a standardized systems engineering decision support tool set.  The solution will employ the Rational Unified Process framework to define a tailored mechanism for iterative product engineering, effective management of changes and clear traceability of operational requirements to the design solution. This effort will also inform refinements to AFMCs Sustainment Business Process Model (SBPM.  BENEFIT: Our goal is to develop and deliver a comprehensive decision support capability which gives the sustainment community a tool set that is easy to learn and easy to use.  Our solution will provide Trends/Patterns/Engineering Analysis to support complex systems engineering.  Through the innovative integration of artificial intelligence and emerging technology, our designed capability will enhance synergy of reverse engineering, technology insertion, technology redesign, models, tools, methods and planning.  A fully functioning decision support system designed specifically for systems engineering applications, with a fully integrated inductive reasoning Case Model Generator (CMG), has outstanding commercialization potential.
