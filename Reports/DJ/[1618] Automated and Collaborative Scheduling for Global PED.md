Automated and Collaborative Scheduling for Global PED
=====================================================

# Abstract


Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Operations Center (DOC) schedulers has an urgent need an automated, role-based system to ingest and evaluate global intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) flight schedule changes against available processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) assets to ensure accuracy and scalability as mission requests increase. Currently, the scheduling of these resources for both the 30-day and 72-hour PED plans are done manually and cannot survive at scale. Plus, there is no common format by which the flight schedules come into the DCGS Operations Center (DOC), from the AOCs and no controls or restrictions over who can go into the DOC system and make changes to PED assignments, and no notification is generated regarding the change or its potential impact to other scheduled missions. This prototype will provide an automated global PED scheduling solution to the DOC based on auto-mated data ingestion, machine learning based resource optimization, dynamic visualization, collaboration and fine-grained security control based on SitScape's COTS software.
