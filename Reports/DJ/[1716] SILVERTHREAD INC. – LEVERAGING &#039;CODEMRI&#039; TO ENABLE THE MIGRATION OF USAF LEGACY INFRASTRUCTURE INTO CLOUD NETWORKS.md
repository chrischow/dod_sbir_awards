SILVERTHREAD INC. – LEVERAGING &#039;CODEMRI&#039; TO ENABLE THE MIGRATION OF USAF LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE INTO CLOUD NETWORKS
============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force maintains multiple information systems and legacy infrastructure distributed around the globe, which leads to problems that impact warfighters' and decision makers', and their ability to organize, analyze, secure, scale, and ultimately capitalize on critical information to make timely, data-driven decisions. Cloud Computing (CC) is a fundamental component of the global infrastructure that will empower the warfighter with data and is critical to maintaining AF technological supremacy, as it allows users to store and access data, programs and information from anywhere at any time over the Internet rather than on a local hard drive, effectively removing the need for the user to be in the same physical location as the hardware that stores the data. The Air Force has recently allocated over $1 billion USD to migrate more than 750,000 of its users to cloud-based email, communications and other services. The AF Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), is tasked with providing support systems for information technology networks, command, control, and communications, as well as strategic systems. As such, the AFLCMC is the designated AF stakeholder in implementing Commercial Cloud Computing initiatives.  Silverthread Inc. is a technology company specializing in Software Economics for evaluating and improving the quality, health and performance of software codebases. As part of their initiative, Silverthread has developed a CodeMRI Platform which gives people the ability to measure and visualize their systems, as well as improve the structure of codebases and prevent future problems from emerging.  CodeMRI presents many capabilities including technical health assessments of modularity and complexity, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) predictive models quantifying likely business performance of the development organization, benchmarks to compare a system against thousands of others, schedule estimation capabilities, tools to help executives model the ROI of different strategic options such as refactoring vs. rewrite. CodeMRI is particularly promising as a toolset for managing the migration of legacy codebases to the cloud and can assist the USAF in identifying the best strategic courses of action across its portfolio of legacy systems to be migrated, and more successfully execute that migration and transition to ‘cloud native’ architectures long-term. During this Phase I project, Silverthread's plans to contact the AFLCMC in order to gather use cases, process information, and align with the needs and goals of current 'legacy to Cloud' migration projects. After which, Silverthread will evaluate the technical feasibility of reaching these objectives and determine the most appropriate pilot project. Silverthread will be mindful during the Phase I to select a pilot project that is representative of the needs of other USAF installations to maximize the number of projects for which the solution is directly relevant.
