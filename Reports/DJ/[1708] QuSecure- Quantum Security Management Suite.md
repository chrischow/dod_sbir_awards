QuSecure- Quantum Security Management Suite
===========================================

# Abstract


Quantum Security Management Suite (QSMS). The USAF depends on computers and networks for the Command and Control (C2) of mission critical systems. QSMS provides several features designed to harden this infrastructure against the emerging threat of quantum computing hacking. We use Post-Quantum and Classical Cryptographic KMS (CKMS), designed to manage and protect keys on behalf of a variety of applications including database Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) clients, as well as Data Security Platform solutions. QSMS uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a secure communication method that implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. An important and unique property of quantum key distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. QuSecure’s QSMS is capable of providing the USAF with a Distributed Architecture on Post-Quantum Blockchain for Consensus Based on Non-Repudiation Assurance. QSMS is deployable on appliances, virtual appliances, and in the Cloud (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). QSMS includes Kubernetes Containerized Platform for Zero-Trust Key Management for Post-Quantum Algorithm and Signature Serving, is backwards compatible, with current applications being used on USAF networks. QSMS provides significant, quantitative benefits to the AF, such as Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Attack Detection Logic leveraging Quantum Entanglement Sensing; Deep Learning AI Driven Attack Micro-Segmentation Logic leveraging QKD and Quantum Entanglement-Based Sensing; QKD Device Management, using Management of Key Generation Frequency, Key Distribution and Exchange, Attack Sensing; Network Switch and Router Management through an Application Programming Interface (API) connection to switch infrastructure; and RESTful API for Integration with Current Infrastructure (SysLog, Classical Key Management System (KMS), Hardware and Infrastructure Management). QSMS uses Quantum Resilient Distributed Architecture based on Blockchain. Additionally, we employ the use of Deep Learning AI. Various forms of multifactor authentication are implemented to protect users’ wallets including facial recognition and other forms of biometrics. Lastly, a QSMS communication protocol is created which establishes secure communication between wallets and the blockchain. This protocol is designed to guard against interception style of attacks similar but not limited to “man-in-the-middle, session hijack and replay”. The goal of the QSMS communication protocol is to subdivide packets as they are encoded and transmitted into various “data bits” and are transmitted over differing communication channels to reduce the likelihood of interception and reassembly. The different channels of communication are encoded using varying algorithms from the NIST Approved list and recompiled at the blockchain level.
