Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The object of the proposed research is to investigate the feasibility of developing the Data, Notification, and Action (DNA) software system to enable real-time space situational awareness. DNA is an open source architecture that processes real-time, multi-stream data and incorporates machine learning to distill raw sensor data information autonomously. Through an easy-to-use interface, operators will receive notifications at the onset of anomalies, use predictive modeling to forecast problems, and can publish processed streams of data to the space catalog for collaboration across other government and civil operators. This architecture will be capable of handling Big Data volumes, and will be designed with the flexibility and scalability to integrate a nearly limitless quantity of algorithms and disparate data sources to meet any variety of operator needs.
