# Abstract


Chooch Intelligence Technologies has built a new generation of interconnected neural networks for visual recognition, perception libraries. This new generation of networks makes AI scalable and more accessible to companies and people. Chooch solves training and predictions bottlenecks in AI by integrating different types of deep learning frameworks, models, classes, and neural networks to attain very high identification accuracy. Choochâ€™s perception libraries have solved the below problems in artificial intelligence for training and predictions. - Manual data collection and cleaning process - Neural network models fail with high volume training - Quality of results vary between models and objects - Models do not work outside of strict context Chooch has addressed and solved for these problems, making visual AI scalable and usable by large enterprises and small developers alike.
