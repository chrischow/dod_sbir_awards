# Abstract


Agolo (New York, NY) provides an AI-driven text summarization platform. The Agolo platform uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze hundreds of thousands of open source articles, research documents and proprietary information to give each customer a summary of key points specific to their areas of interest. To-date, Agolo clients have been in the commercial space, primarily financial services, corporate intelligence and media. Investors include Microsoft M12, Google, Tensility Venture Partners, CRV, Thomson Reuters, Franklin Templeton Investments and Columbia University. We believe that Agolo summarization can provide a competitive advantage in national defense applications, specifically in relation to Focus Area 19.3 section 4, by enabling analysts and other knowledge workers to scale their analyses and identify new insights.
