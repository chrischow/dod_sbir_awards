# Abstract


HyPerComps effort involves the development and verification of exact-physics, computational electromagnetics (CEM) modeling and simulation (M&S) software (SW) capable of accounting for both the submarine masts and the surrounding ocean at the EM wavelengths of interest. The effort will generate synthetic data for sensor algorithms that use machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for automatic target recognition (ATR) and SAR/ISAR imaging of maritime targets.This proposed effort will lead to a high order accurate, physics-based, full wave modeling and simulation capability for NAVAIR in understanding the various discriminating electromagnetic scattering features (direct and multi-bounce, creeping and traveling waves, and wave interaction/penetration with sea water) that can support the detection of periscopes in the presence of sea clutter. The end goal of this Phase II effort is to provide NAVAIR with a high-fidelity, physics-based simulation capability for use in the design of radar algorithms for use in high grazing angle maritime target (especially periscope / mast) detection and discrimination.
