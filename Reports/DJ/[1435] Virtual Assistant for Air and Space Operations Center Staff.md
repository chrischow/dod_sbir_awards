# Abstract


Multi-domain command and control (MDC2) requires an efficient and effective capability to perform cross-domain effects synchronizationâ€”for example, coordinating a planned air strike mission from one operation center around an ongoing cyber mission from another. We propose to build Effects Explorer, which combines an intuitive interface with state-of-the-art data analysis to accelerate effects synchronization across air, cyber, and space domains. Effects Explorer will integrate and customize C2Core and Solr to search across domains, data types, and command centers; display the results in a format familiar to operations center personnel and integrate the search results with the existing software; and apply artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to suggest relevant searches and to quickly filter results. C2Core is a family of software applications operational worldwide at U.S. Air Force AOCs and used by coalition partners. Solr is a widely used open source enterprise search platform. Effects Explorer will leverage these two systems to enable strategy, planning, and execution personnel to visualize and synchronize cross-domain effects in an accurate and timely manner. During Phase II, the proposal team will: refine the requirements and design, develop the software in agile cycles, evaluate the system with end-users, and address transition requirements.
