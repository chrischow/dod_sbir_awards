Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to address the problem of Rapid Anomaly Characterization of Satellites in Real-time. The operational space community collects a wealth of information from its on-orbit satellites downlink feeds; referred to as State-of-Health Telemetry (SOH TLM). This information consists of a large number (thousands to tens of thousands) of monitored telemetry points collected from every satellite each second. New AI Machine Learning (ML) approaches (such as Deep Learning), along with the emergence of commercial and open-source AI tools with Program as a Service (PaaS) environments, provide an opportunity to leverage the valuable SOH TLM data for use in an operational SSA environment.
