# Abstract


Bastille is an Enterprise Security product that uses Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Machine Learning (ML) technology to monitor the electromagnetic spectrum for radio frequency (RF) emissions from wireless devices and accurately place dots on a floor-plan map for device location, as well as send alerts when a device is found where it should not be or doing what it should not do. Bastille performs the find, fix, and track elements of the cyber kill chain. Bastille can 1) see when a new wireless device enters a space, 2) determine if the wireless device presents a cyber security or physical security threat, and 3) track the wireless device both in the physical and cyber sense as it performs its wireless functions and moves through the space. Bastille uses physical SDR sensors in an environment that constantly scan the spectrum and decode wireless emissions. Bastille can detect and monitor Cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy devices e.g. cellphones, fitness trackers, laptops, smart watches, wireless peripherals, medical wearables like hearing aids, TVs, and IoT devices like thermostats, building control systems, and smart appliances like lightbulbs. Security teams use Bastille to enforce granular policy about mobile and personal devices inside their space.
