Innovative Position Navigation and Timing
=========================================

# Abstract


Third Insight specializes in low-cost, mobile platforms that perform 3D positional tracking and mapping when GPS is untrustworthy or unavailable. Our patent-pending approach uses sensor fusion and artificial intelligence to enhance commonly available hardware platforms, including standard body cameras and autonomous drones. We propose to perform customer discovery, feasibility and utility assessments of an â€œIntelligent Body Cameraâ€� for the war fighter. An off-the-shelf body camera would be modified to include an embedded processor running Third Insightâ€™s neural networks, computer vision, position-estimation and mapping algorithms. The resulting mobile device would provide: * Dense, 3D visual maps around the war fighter as she navigates within buildings or unknown terrain * Centimeter-accurate, 3D trajectories of her path, useful for egress, tracking and command and control * Integration of multiple war fightersâ€™ (local) 3D visual maps into a single (global) 3D visual map that would enable autonomous drones and other teams to better plan future operations * Facial recognition to identify and track targets-of-interest * Cyber-hardened software implementation and FIPS-encrypted communications In summary, Third Insightâ€™s commercial solution would provide real-time situational awareness about both 3D tracking and visual cues â€“ terrain, building interiors and targets-of-interest â€“ that existing PNT technologies do not address.
