Machine Learning for Defense Aviation Applications
==================================================

# Abstract


The stated goal of AF183-002 is to “leverage advances in machine learning technologies to address specific defense challenges” including “supply chain and infrastructure asset management.” As a partnership with the organization National Security Innovation Network (NSIN, formerly known as MD5), this topic seeks “solutions that have proven their value in the commercial sector and to see if they have an application for an Air Force problem.” With permission from the Air Force/NSIN, the Navy will work against this topic against Navy assets to include a heavy lift helicopter, tactical airborne early warning aircraft, & a tactical aircraft. This project endeavors to apply advanced machine learning services and commercial products to rapidly prototype predictive models for sensor data, maintenance records and inventory/supply chain management efforts. After establishing whether or not the data science is possible in the base period, Option 1 will explore activities to scale the results into the Navy Enterprise. Option 2 will explore system integration of the results into diverse IT environments (eg, shipboard, CONUS, OCONUS, etc).
