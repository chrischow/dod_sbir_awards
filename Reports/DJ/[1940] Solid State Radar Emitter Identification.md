Solid State Radar Emitter Identification
========================================

# Abstract


Recent advances in new, solid state radar technology, signal processing techniques, and the use of actively electronically scanned arrays (AESA) has reduced our ability to detect radar emissions and has had a negative impact on the US Navyâ€™s technological supremacy in electronic warfare (EW). Advanced detection and navigation radars also employ many modes of operation, including Low Peak Power (LPP) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) waveforms and have the ability to take advantage of agile waveform techniques which can rapidly vary pulse repetition patterns, carrier frequency, pulse width, modulation type, polarization, and scan intervals. Newer adaptable radar systems may also continuously change waveforms in order to mitigate channel effects or provide optimum returns based on target radar cross section (RCS). Expedition Technology, Inc. (EXP) has developed Wideband Identification of Solid State Emitters (WISSE), a new and innovative set of digital signal processing and pulse de-interleaving algorithms to better detect and identify solid state navigation and threat radars using sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) techniques that support single pulse identification and reduce pulse classification ambiguity.
