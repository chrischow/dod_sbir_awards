Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Against peer-competitors, the US Air Force will require an ability to rapidly transition AI algorithms for maneuver robotics from development in synthetic environments to employment on real-world platforms. The proposed effort will establish a methodology for this transition. The methodology will be validated in the context of artificially intelligent small UAS (SUAS) platforms capable of self-directed missions in GPS-denied reconnaissance in cluttered, unstructured environments. This effort anticipates a Phase II objective of applying the methodology for the development and validation of AI capabilities for autonomous systems that accomplish priority objectives for the USAF.
