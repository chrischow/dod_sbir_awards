# Abstract


This Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) SBIR proposal describes how Micro Analysis and Design (MA&D) and Basic Commerce and Industries (BCI) will extensively automate monitoring and evaluation of data link track coherency (i.e. Track Information Quality) from a battle force exercise.  A two year plan is presented that will leverage MA&D's software development and user interface design expertise and BCI's knowledge of Naval operations and Track Information Quality (TIQ).  The MA&D team will coordinate with NAVSEA and extend previous TIQ efforts to develop a software tool that will be flexible in design and architecture and will accommodate future advances in information technology.  Data extraction, reduction and analysis previously requiring hours of Subject Matter Expert (SME) intervention will be realized with the aid of artificial intelligence algorithms thereby allowing feedback to the Battle Group Commander, Air Defense Commander and Air Defense Team on a daily basis rather than only at the end of an exercise.  As an option to this SBIR program, we will investigate the feasibility and provide options for developing a real time TIQ capability.
