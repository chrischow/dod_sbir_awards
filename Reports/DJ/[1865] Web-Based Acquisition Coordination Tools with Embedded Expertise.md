Web-Based Acquisition Coordination Tools with Embedded Expertise
================================================================

# Abstract


Modernizing naval vessels is a tremendously complex task, requiring coordinated effort by representatives of many different organizations, and subject to frequently shifting temporal, fiscal, physical, and technological constraints.  The Navy lacks automated tools to support key modernization decision-makers.  In particular, Participating Managers (PARMs) need coordination and decision support in modeling, planning, and tracking projects.  Filling this need defines the vision underlying Acquisition Decision Expert Planning Technology for Modernization (ADEPT-M). Our approach to realizing ADEPT-M draws on our extensive experience building and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools including decision-aids, planners, simulations, and knowledge management environments for military problems.  It also draws on our proven capability integrating core visualization, knowledge representation, inference, and intelligent behavior control capabilities in web-based environments to support distributed work. In this Phase I project, we propose to (1) identify the requirements for an effective ADEPT-M system, (2) define an appropriate overarching technology architecture responsive to those requirements, (3) develop a corresponding software system design and build plan, and (4) produce a limited proof-of-concept demonstration with supporting documentation.  The ultimate ADEPT-M system will provide an innovative mix of collaboration and expert-system decision-support capabilities for modeling, planning, and tracking ship modernization in an easily useable and available web-based format.
