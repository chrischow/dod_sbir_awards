Integrated Aiding and Training
==============================

# Abstract


Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop the Warfighter Wiki, an innovative approach to collect, store, and present informal knowledge that today is commonly placed in continuity folders. Informal knowledge includes heuristics and knowledge that is tied to particular work situations. While the DoD manages formal knowledge well (in manuals, schoolhouse training, and promotion tests), situated job knowledge is left to expert field users to collect, and to pass on to others who need to learn it.  IAI’s expertise in Instructional Design, Web-based technologies, and Artificial Intelligence will enable us to build powerful tools so that the Warfighter Wiki can manage informal knowledge in a very efficient and effective process. Key advantages of our approach are that we are adding features to a tool (a wiki) that already possesses many of the requirements for an informal knowledge repository. We collect content in a structured way, so that job aiding content can also be used for job training. We will build tools using advanced technologies to help users create or refine their job knowledge content. Finally, we are keenly aware that any system that will supplant continuity folders must be easy to use, and must address users’ privacy concerns.
