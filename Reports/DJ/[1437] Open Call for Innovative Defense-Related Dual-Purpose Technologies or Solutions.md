Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions
============================================================================

# Abstract


Currently, the Air Force (AF) is not connecting crucial data from different sources, which means that key data is left behind. To improve decision-making, the AF needs access and end-to-end visibility of all key data. One end user, AFLCMC/ACSâ€™s Support Equipment & Vehicles (SE&V), manages all AF support equipment & vehicles worldwide. For SE&V, 14bis Supply Tracking will develop a working prototype and all documentation of a solution providing end-to-end visibility with systems interoperability and data analytics with actionable triggers. The result will help the AF better manage the common support equipment fleet. The proposed system will provide more accurate information about the location and health of each piece of support equipment, allowing for data-driven buy/repair decisions. While actual use of the trial (& fielded system, if successful & leads to Phase III) is limited to SE&V, the Impact will be felt throughout the USAF: it will allow better common support equipment fleet management. The proposed system will provide more accurate information about the location & health of each piece of support equipment, allowing it to make data-driven buy/repair decisions. Future implementations will provide systems interoperability, full digital asset traceability, maximum security and extend 14bisâ€™ offer to include data analytics.
