Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based C2 Digital Assistant
=======================================================

# Abstract


The Marine Corps seeks to employ advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for its CAC2S program to reduce information overload, improve situational awareness (SA) and collaboration, and aid in Commander decision-making. Leverege will use its unrivaled subject matter expertise in CAC2S and its deep experience with cutting-edge machine learning techniques to research and test the optimal algorithms for the AI-based digital assistant. Our research and development will identify the areas that need to be addressed, propose and study alternative solutions, and provide simulated but relevant input to test our hypotheses against known CAC2S use cases. Our proposed technical solution is a modified version of Googles SyntaxNet and TensorFlow; an open-source AI framework that implements a feedforward neural network with a greedy transition-based parser. The open-source nature of those frameworks allows us to ultimately build an embedded AI system that can be installed on a classified CAC2S network without a connection to the Internet.
