CloudCover CyberSafety AI/ML Security Platform
==============================================

# Abstract


Cybersecurity threats are polymorphic and rapidly changing which makes it difficult to mitigate ever mutating communications, networks, and data links. The problem the Air Force is trying to solve is zero-day attacks. Additionally, most Air Force (AF) security systems are porous and passive, meaning once an attack has been identified, the AF tries to repair damage that has been done and update their system to resist similar attacks in the future. The CloudCover CyberSafety B1 Platform (“CS/B1”) is an automated cybersecurity intelligent threat management platform utilizing AI machine learning (AI/ML) that performs network security, orchestration, automation, response (SOAR) to identify, analyze, and block never-before-seen cyber security threats. The CS/B1 solution can mitigate multi-threats to AF networks automatically at sub-second speeds with 99.9999999% accuracy. What takes days or weeks to protect and defend, CS/B1 can mitigate in microseconds. The CCB1 Platform has logged well over trillions of transmissions (over 41 billion identified cyber-attacks) against our customer base and the CCB1 has defeated every adversary at sub-second speed with accuracy — allowing us to state that our customers have never experienced a data breach. We can deploy today on AF networks and allow the AF to realize similar protections our commercial customers enjoy today. The CS/B1 capabilities are critical in protecting the AF/WTF, whereby it becomes the squadron’s better cyber security protector.
