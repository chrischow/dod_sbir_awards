# Abstract


Bettermeant Health believes that healthcare is a deeply personal journey and that it should be a journey not taken alone. The company was started with the belief that Americans deserve to be able to have greater access to their own healthcare, beginning with the military. The Bettermeant platform – with full software stack creates a seamless solution for service members, veterans, and their families. Integrating the Bettermeant platform with USAF, DoD and VA medical systems will mitigate healthcare transition issues at the end of a service member’s military duty. The Bettermeant platform can act as a “marketplace” for the service member and automatically link medical records to private and commercial healthcare providers following the transition. This will reduce logistics and eliminate the administrative overhead associated with this process. ​​​​​​Convenient: Interfacing with existing AFMS (or VA) systems in a powerful platform while also continuing to integrate with modern digital solutions for a full-stack healthcare handling platform. Secure: Using a HIPAA compliant and secure platform to enable a conversation and health data sharing with the service member (dependent or veteran) and their healthcare team. Allows all members of the support team to collaborate via secure messaging.  Transparent:  Access to healthcare solutions begins with patient education and advocacy. It allows for smarter analytics to drive healthcare choices and smart suggestions for preventative care. Robust: By applying advanced data science techniques we can help patients as they seek health information that is personalized for their needs. Allowing us to make healthcare scalable and applicable to more members of USAF, DoD and VA.
