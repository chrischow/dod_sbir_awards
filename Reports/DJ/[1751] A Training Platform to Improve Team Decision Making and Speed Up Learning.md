A Training Platform to Improve Team Decision Making and Speed Up Learning
=========================================================================

# Abstract


For managers spending time and money on training, Beagle Learning provides an instantly configured training platform and problem-solving method that increases team decision-making speed from day one. Our software walks teams through a process of identifying a goal, then following a four step cycle of asking a question, researching an answer, distilling their learnings, and reflecting on their progress. This seemingly obvious process is rarely used consistently because teams don’t have easy tools to get them started. Our software system and proprietary materials give teams the simple, systematized process they need. Beagle’s machine learning then measures team problem solving ability using the questions asked. We have run five paid pilots with 1,000 higher education students. These pilots demonstrated up to 50% increases in classroom engagement, 18% increases in freshman pass rates, and dramatic transformations of team culture.
