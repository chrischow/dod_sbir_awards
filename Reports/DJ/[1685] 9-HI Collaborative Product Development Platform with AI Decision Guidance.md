9-HI Collaborative Product Development Platform with AI Decision Guidance
=========================================================================

# Abstract


American Ingenuity LLC has been invited to and applied for the March 12 Pitch event in Austin Texas. 9-HI is a collaborative product development platform using artificial intelligence for decision guidance. The 9-HI collaboration platform was developed by American Ingenuity Consulting (AIC) to allow government procurement and SMEs from government, industry and academia to work with a common tool set to accelerate technology development by measuring strengths and weaknesses and then removing risks from the development and procurement process. 9-HI-based machine learning and artificial intelligence allows us to treat historical and real-time data as an organized set of evidence for optimized recommendations to drive successful product innovation outcomes. 9-HI improves the selection and development decision processes. Our process starts with capturing DoD user input on existing technologies and product assets. Numerous measurement factors recommended by SMEs, users and later AI are rolled up into a standardized 9-point scoring system that employs algorithms to optimize target outputs and clearly identify risks as gaps, barriers or vulnerabilities. Comparisons between competing technologies inform procurement and SMEs regarding selection of the best technologies and development and procurement options to accelerate implementations from years to months. 9-HI is applied to every step of selection and development. After each use, 9-HI saves all data in a novel storage regime that allows for simplified recall for other related applications.  9-HI is based on a novel AI approach that uses Higher Order Logic (HOL) to guide reinforced Machine Learning. Because the 9-HI HOL is in the form of a mathematical power set, it is able to represent ( capture and compare all options within the art of the possible. Thus, any development option can be scored and compared to aid in the decision process.   Our Phase II and III committed customer is JPEO Ammunition & Armament. They will have a direct Air Force benefit as they have significant Air Force personnel within their organization and flow A&A benefits from their technology development activities directly to Air Force A&A applications. The secondary yet powerful benefit is that they also have team members form the US Army US Navy and US Marine Corps on their collaborative leadership teams that can be tapped to help grow the trans-service applications of 9-HI. This is a significant portion of our development and growth plans for this platform.
