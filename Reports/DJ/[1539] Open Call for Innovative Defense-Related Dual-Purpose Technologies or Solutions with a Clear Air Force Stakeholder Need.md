# Abstract


USAF and DoD programs have the requirement for high trust multi-level separation / segmentation methods which are compatible with embedded computing hardware and Operating Systems (OS) to protect against cyber threats as well as protect classified data in storage and in transit during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). Management Sciences, Inc. and our subcontractor, General Dynamics Mission Systems, have developed a commercial Multi-Level Security Partition Module (MSPM) that provides comprehensive cyber assurance and cybersecurity protection for multiple levels of classified information on embedded computing devices. The MSPM is built from MSIâ€™s Artificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning engine and GDMS CSfC-certified commercial OKL4 microvisor. The proposed MSPM product for defense applications differs from the commercial GDMS OKL4 product because MSPM employs a Separation Kernel/Hypervisor designed and developed for high-assurance systems, and supports full virtualization, enabling guest operating systems and legacy applications to run unmodified. MSI proposes a Direct to The USAF program of record for Phase III is the AFLCMC munitions office. Phase 2 will develop and deliver a MSPM as a Trusted Information Assurance product for protecting precision munitions from cyber threats.
