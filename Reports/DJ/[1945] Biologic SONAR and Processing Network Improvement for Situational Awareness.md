Biologic SONAR and Processing Network Improvement for Situational Awareness
===========================================================================

# Abstract


The ASSETT Team, comprised of ASSETT, Inc., Texas A&Ms Dr. Smotherman and MNW Associates, intends to develop a machine learning process to improve performance of high frequency sonar. Our added learning process incorporating knowledge base, learning mode, and feedback from enhanced monitoring will enable the sonar to emulate the echolocation behavior of bats and dolphin. Dolphin have no problem in shallow littorals with complex bathymetry, non iso-velocity, and non-isotropic environments that challenge current high frequency sonar effectiveness. The ASSETT Team will apply mammalian adaptive behavior to improve operational dependability of high frequency sonars in these challenging environments.
