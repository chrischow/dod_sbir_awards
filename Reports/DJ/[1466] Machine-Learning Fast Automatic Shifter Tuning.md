Machine-Learning Fast Automatic Shifter Tuning
==============================================

# Abstract


To address the Air Force need for an improved thermal characterization process for ferrite phase shifters used in phased array antennas, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has developed a new Machine-Learning Fast Automatic Shifter Tuning (M-FAST) system. The current method to characterize ferrite phase shifters used in phased array antennas during the overhaul process at OC-ALC requires a minimum of 16 hr. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of M-FAST by measuring and characterizing a phase shifter. POC-developed intelligent log data analysis tools in M-FAST reduce the number of response curves required to fully characterize each phase shifter from several dozen to less than ten. As a result, M-FAST can measure more phase shifters in a shorter time and with fewer measurement points, meeting the Air Force requirements for this topic. In Phase II, POC will optimize the M-FAST algorithm to reduce the cost and improve the quality of repairs that require the characterization process and will perform validation testing and performance evaluation of the M-FAST system. During Phase III, POC intends to commercialize M-FAST for use by commercial and/or Government, overhaul entities, and DoD user/depot facilities.
