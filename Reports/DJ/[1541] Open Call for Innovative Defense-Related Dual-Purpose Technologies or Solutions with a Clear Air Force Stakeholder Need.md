# Abstract


Anno is a machine learning data platform that provides data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists a data curation tool capable of annotating mission-oriented machine learning models that can be rapidly iterated. Anno, as â€œThe GitHub for machine learning dataâ€� supports the annotation of public and private datasets, including video, imagery, and audio. The platform is available as a cloud-based or on-prem solution for sensitive data (classified, regulation controlled, intellectual property). The Anno.ai platform provides a scalable, secure solution that seamlessly enables subject matters to annotate vast quantities of sensitive data quickly for building and iterating machine learning models.
