Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


In order to support an integrated MDO, we propose conducting a feasibility study to develop a central application solution for collecting/validating/securing/processing the data, display recommended actions (based on a learning application solution), and provide continuous analytics. We would look to using Blockchain for validation, security validation and audit trail. We would work to use our AI (Artificial Intelligence) and BI (Business Intelligence) that is built into our Azure PowerLine toolset - along with adding Big Data and Deep Learning to provide predictive insight models which could provide USAF the next best actions for pilots, ground troops, command centers, etc., in real-time or near real-time. This solution would create a Multi-Domain Operations â€“ Integration Solution (MDO-IS). The MDO-Integrated Solution service components include: Azure; PowerLine; AI; BI; Predictive Analysis; Big Data; Deep Learning; and Machine Learning (ML).
