Business Process Transformation Tool for Rapid Reconfiguration of Navy Systems
==============================================================================

# Abstract


We propose a comprehensive solution to dynamically compose command and control components in semi- and even fully- automated fashion. We can create FORCEnet Engagement Packs (FnEPs) that combine weapons, sensors, mission threads, business process definitions, and simulations via a 4-layer model. Layer 1 overcomes a huge impediment, namely that weapon and sensor platforms were never designed to work with other combinations, by automation tools funded by PEO IWS and ONR: uReuse and uGlue respectively. uReuse analyzes legacy system code to classify how to expose information and operations as services. uGlue creates graphs to transform disparate data models from different systems to work with each other, based on a data registry that uses fuzzy matching, data mining, and ontological inference. We can add many information sources: SOAP, REST, JMS, DDS, IRC, CORBA, SQL, â€¦. In Layer 2 an operator can manually combine business process templates and rules to form FnEPs. Layer 3 supports semi-automated FnEP creation by adding intelligent BP reconfiguration through goal-planning artificial intelligence (AI) methods, using predicate logic and programming and situation calculus concepts, and learning to be self-modifying. Layer 4 matures layer 3, adding automated threat and intent recognition to realize an Automated Battle Management Aid (ABMA).
