High Speed High Accuracy Artificial Neural Networks for UAV based Target Identification
=======================================================================================

# Abstract


The machine learning and artificial intelligence community has recently garnered much attention for ground breaking performance of novel neural network architectures for self-driving cars. One of the machine learning methods used in self-driving cars is semantic segmentation. In this fashion each pixel in an image is label with a class, allowing for contour-based image segmentation which is different than the traditional sliding windows technique used in convolutional neural networks. UHV has previously developed a contour-based image segmentation technique for several of its commercially available products which include machinery in industrial recycling. In this Phase I effort UHV Technologies will develop innovative methods for target identification for UAV and UAS with state of the art machine learning methods in semantic segmentation, by modifying their existing ML/AI software, then demonstrate the technology at one of the nationâ€™s six major test sites for UAVs and UASs with UTARI. The Phase II work will include optimizing SWaP parameters in addition to customizing the algorithms for specific applications.
