Advancing the State of the Art in Artificial Intelligence for Simulation Training
=================================================================================

# Abstract


We aim to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) software that is generalized across entity-level simulation systems and can be used to generate behaviors in training simulations that are both contextually and tactically realistic. The near-term goal for Phase I is to define and develop a concept for improving simulation training using AI in VBS2 and JSAF, focusing on improving the behavioral realism of the AI while reducing the need for support personnel.
