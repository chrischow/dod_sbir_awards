Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need

# Abstract


We propose a collaborative, shared virtual environment where humans can interact with satellite data and other space assets, with machine intelligence tools, and with each other in an intuitive manner to enable rapid analytics and decision-making of the space environment. Specifically, we are submitting Phase I topic to pitch Phase III on Space Pitch Day. This proposal addresses AF192-001 Focus Area 1: Space Pitch Day, and Focus Needs 6265: Artificial Intelligence to enhance Air Force Situational Awareness and manage assets. Using the Virtualitics Immersive Platform, a state-of-the-art software combining machine learning and virtual reality, we aim to determine the feasibility and the effectiveness of visualizing satellite and space object data in a virtual environment as a means to improve space situational awareness, indications and warnings. The primary goals of this environment are to enable an intuitive visualization and understanding of multiple satellite trajectories as well as results from data analytics in real time. As the amount of space assets and related information grows, it will become increasingly challenging for space analysts and leadership to keep track of the data and identify anomalies/threats in real time using traditional data analysis/visualization tools. It will also become more difficult to communicate insights related
