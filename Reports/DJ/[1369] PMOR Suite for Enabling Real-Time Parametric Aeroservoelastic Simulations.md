PMOR Suite for Enabling Real-Time Parametric Aeroservoelastic Simulations
=========================================================================

# Abstract


The main objectives of this SBIR Phase II effort are to implement, validate, and deploy at the Air Force Test Center at the Edwards Air Force Base an innovative computational technology based on adaptive, Projection-based Reduced-Order Models (PROMs) that can be operable as: a predictive tool to estimate aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic stability and aerodynamic loads prior to testing; a real-time system that takes inputs from a given live flight test and outputs a corresponding estimate of the aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic stability and aerodynamic loads; and a pilot-in-the-loop aeroservoelastic/aeroelastic simulator. This technology is based on the concept of parametric, fluid-structure PROMs. Its feasibility was demonstrated during Phase I of this effort. For linear and linearized problems, its pillars include a database of PROMs, and real-time algorithms for interpolation on matrix manifolds. For nonlinear problems, its key components include machine learning algorithms for constructing local reduced-order bases, and hyper reduction methods for enabling real-time approximations in these reduced bases. For all applications, it features greedy algorithms for sampling the parameter domain of interest, and a nonparametric probabilistic approach for adapting a computed PROM using test data. Because fluid-structure interaction problems are ubiquitous in engineering, this technology has dualuse applications and a significant potential for commercial exploitation.
