Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Awake Security Platform performs deep analysis of data from the â€new networkâ€â€”traditional, cloud and Internet of Things networks. Awake uses this information to autonomously profile entities such as devices, users and applications, uncover and correlate complex adversarial behaviors targeting organizations like the Air Force and enables rapid triage, incident response and remediation. As many breaches are now the result of attackers abusing insider privileges and legitimate tools, traditional security approaches that demand a high-level of human expertise are proving to be inadequate. Awake delivers ground-breaking artificial intelligence innovations in the worldâ€™s only autonomous platform that provides situational awareness of the environment, threat detection and breach response capabilities in a single solution. Awake customers have seen up to an 88% reduction in the time to detect and time to respond to attacks, a 3x average improvement in situational awareness of the environment and a signal-to-noise ratio of 95%--almost 15 times better than the competition.
