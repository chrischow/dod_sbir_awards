Web-Based Acquisition Coordination Tools with Embedded Expertise
================================================================

# Abstract


It is tremendously difficult to outfit and modernize naval vessels.  Coordinated effort is required from representatives of many different organizations, subject to frequently shifting temporal, fiscal, physical, and technological constraints.  The Navy lacks automated tools to support key acquisition decision-makers.  In particular Warfare Systems Engineering (WSEs) and Combat Systems Engineers (CSEs) need coordination and decision support in modeling, planning, and tracking projects.  Filling this need defines the vision underlying Acquisition Decision Expert Planning Technology for Systems Engineering (ADEPT-SE). Our approach to realizing ADEPT-SE draws on our extensive experience building and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools including decision-aids, planners, simulations, and knowledge management environments for military problems.  It also draws on our proven capability integrating core visualization, knowledge representation, inference, and intelligent behavior control capabilities in web-based environments to support distributed work. In this Phase II project, we propose to (1) iteratively refine requirements and designs to drive construction of successively more capable ADEPT-SE prototypes, (2) evaluate releases of the prototype through feature testing, user evaluations, and finally pilot testing, (3) develop an appropriate technology transition plan that leads to introduction of novel and useful new capability into the Naval acquisition process.  The ultimate ADEPT-SE system will provide an innovative mix of multi-user collaboration and expert-system decision-support capabilities for modeling, planning, and tracking ship systems acquisition in an easily useable and available web-based format.
