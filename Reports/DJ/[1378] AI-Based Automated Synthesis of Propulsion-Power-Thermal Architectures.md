AI-Based Automated Synthesis of Propulsion-Power-Thermal Architectures
======================================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT: SpaceWorks Enterprises, Inc. (SEI) seeks government support for the development of an automated tool for generating, assessing, and optimizing traditional and novel propulsion-power-thermal (PPT) architectures with applications ranging from high-speed aviation to space access. Once fully enabled, the fast-running, multi-platform tool will utilize an expert system, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), to construct candidate PPT systems based on user-specified requirements and desirements.; BENEFIT: It is anticipated that the demand for the commercial sale of this product will be very strong. For most aerospace transportation systems, the main propulsion system is both a major cost and schedule driver. By using this tool early in the vehicle design process, aerospace companies could greatly reduce their propulsion development cost and time by identifying the most promising propulsion system cycle early in the design phase.
