Commercial Solutions for Innovative Space Data Analytics
========================================================

# Abstract


Our innovation is an Intelligent Dynamic Workspace that leverages machine learning to provide data fusion and organization. The solution provides the warfighter with a dashboard interface, powered by a user-level Micro-AI, solving the problem of aggregating digital data and also analyzing it for relationships and relevancy. The system then suggests contextual solutions, improving the warfighter's response and resolution time by 30 to 60 percent. It is common for warfighters to utilize specialized software to accomplish tasks based on the mission, but for that software to be incompatible with other platforms. Our solution's Micro-AI component gathers data from all available platforms and dynamically presents organized results to end users. The workspace is end-user configured, using natural language phrases to connect to all the usersâ€™ collaborative tools in one place, enabling users to be effective in minutes. The solution is highly adaptable to a wide range of potential applications. The solution enables its user-level AI to suggest workflows, monitor users, provide predictive analytics, aggregate data for action, and communicate with other disparate software platforms, thus making it possible for each user to accomplish work faster and reach solutions sooner. This assists the warfighter to be more effective overall in accomplishing mission goals.
