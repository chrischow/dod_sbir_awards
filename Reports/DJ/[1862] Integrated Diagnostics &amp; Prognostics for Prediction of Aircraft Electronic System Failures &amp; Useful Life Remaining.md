Integrated Diagnostics &amp; Prognostics for Prediction of Aircraft Electronic System Failures &amp; Useful Life Remaining
==========================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Impact Technologies, in collaboration with Honeywell Inc., proposes to develop and demonstrate improved on-board embedded diagnostics for avionics as well as open communications architectures that enable information continuity between on-board and off-board systems or maintenance aids. Within this paradigm shift approach, embedded diagnostics improvements will be sought through the evaluation of improved sensed features, various artificial intelligence methods, and more detailed consideration of available data, both embedded and from a data bus monitor. The application of avionics reliability and aging (usage) models to improve assessments or resolve ambiguity will also be addressed. In addition, an ambiguity group analysis that employs data fusion will be developed to assist the at-wing, automated test equipment, if necessary, to rank probable causes. Complementary prognostic techniques including analysis of projected operating conditions by physics-based component aging models, empirical (trending) models, and system level failure progression models will be used to develop verifiable prognostic models. The proposed approach, diagnostic techniques, and prognostic models will be demonstrated during the Phase I. The utilization of all of these sources of engineering information can provide up-to-date assessments and predictions of remaining useful life for use in automated logistics systems.
