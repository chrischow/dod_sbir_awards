Kessel Run Pitch Day- Machine Learning Cyber Security
=====================================================

# Abstract


DeepArmorÂ® EndpointProtection Cyber attacks continue to grow in complexity, scale, and tactics, easily defeating legacy AV solutions and challenging IT teams on a daily basis. The DeepArmorÂ® Endpoint Protection platform leverages the power of big data and our patented machine learning algorithms to offer leading protection against the most advanced attacks in a simple, lightweight solution. Organizations can use DeepArmor to immediately improve their security posture while eliminating tedious signature updates and management complexity. Key Product Capabilities AI Multi-VectorProtection,BuiltfromAI:DeepArmorleverages groundbreaking algorithms and patented model building tools to predict and prevent across every attack vector including file-based, file-less and in-memory attacks â€¢ Pre-ExecutionPrevention:DeepArmorinterceptsandpre- vents attacks before they can execute, eliminating the need for post-infection behavioral analysis, ineffective system rollbacks and time-intensive reimaging â€¢ NoHeuristics,NoSignatures,NoControlFeatures:DeepAr- mor leverages the power of AI to prevent unknown zero-day attacks with no need for rigid heuristics (e.g., YARA), out of date signatures or rudimentary â€œon/offâ€� control features Key Benefits: Prevent zero-day malware and ransomware infections Prevent unknown script, macro and document attacks Prevent fileless and in-memory attacks Lightweight, cognitive agent Simplify deployment and operation with out-of-the-box protection Replace legacy antivirus with learning algorithms Â©SparkCognition, Inc. 2018.
