# Abstract


AI.Reverie is a synthetic data simulation platform which generates an entirely new class of data that successfully trains and improves computer vision algorithms at scale. In order to train mission critical computer vision applications, there is a significant need for large amounts of diverse data that mimics real world locations and objects. Our company specializes in computer vision challenges - object detection and activity recognition - where data is highly sparse or non existent. AI.Reverieâ€™s sophisticated computer vision platform integrates machine learning and AI by generating synthetic data to help offset the costs of labeled real world data and images that are highly rare and unforeseen to mitigate risks associated with real world data biases. The companyâ€™s technology trains the latest state of the art computer vision algorithms, which empowers drone warfare and keeps soldiers safe. AI.Reverieâ€™s platform automatically generates fully annotated synthetic data at scale (i.e., in the millions). The ability to synthetically generate data around scenarios that are highly dangerous, but are often difficult to find in the real world helps train algorithms that are better able to empower analysts in making life saving decisions.
