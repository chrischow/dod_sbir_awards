DLS Engineering- Predictive Analytic Tool for Pilot Career Longevity, Fulfillment, and Success
==============================================================================================

# Abstract


DLS Engineering (Prime) and teaming partner Your6 (Subcontractor), hereinafter Team DLS, offer the Air Force a unique cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) product called Lillian: A Predictive Analytics Tool for Pilot Career Longevity, Fulfillment, and Success - hereinafter, Lillian. Lillian will enable the USAF invest in candidates that have a strong inherent potential for success and create a balanced pilot production, absorption, and sustainment ecosystem to tackle the pilot shortage head on. Lillian employs a Predictive Hiring Intelligence Algorithm that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to evaluate a pilot candidate's education, training, and experience in parallel with their culture, background, personality traits and behaviors, and motivations. This assessment enables us to provide a recommendation that more accurately assesses the viability of candidates' success and reduces the percentage of wash out during pilot training. Additionally, by implementing Lillian, this produces a reduction in the cost associated with training and re-training pilots by aligning the most qualified candidates with pilot programs from the start. Lillian is a platform that is integrated with a proprietary algorithm to match Airmen to e.g., the F-35 program, based on the Airmen's profile including test scores, personal interests, career plans, motivation, etc. This not only evaluates an Airmen to determine a fit with the F-35 program but also assess their ability to succeed. While Lillian assesses an Airmen's viability as a pilot candidate, it can also be used to evaluate and assess other Airmen with a career in the Air Force that aligns with their own personal and career goals and enable them to succeed in the Air Force. Additionally, Lillian can be used to assess the continual motivation of Airmen and potential uses that may arise affecting their motivation.
