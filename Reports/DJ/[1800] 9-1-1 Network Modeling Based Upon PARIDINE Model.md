9-1-1 Network Modeling Based Upon PARIDINE Model
================================================

# Abstract


SecureLogix is a current performer on the PARIDINE project and is focused on defining and detecting attacks such as Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) and other call pattern-based attacks against 9-1-1 networks. Our approach is to enhance our cloud-based Orchestra One Call Authentication Service (CAS), extending its inherent authentication and spoofing detection capabilities, with the ability to use machine learning to detect TDoS attacks. We propose to build a Modeling Tool, which is used to provide awareness/education demonstrations, allow what if scenarios to be performed for planning, and active training of Public Safety Answering Points (PSAP) call takers. The Modeling Tool will be used to identify choke points in their network and determine the best methods to mitigate a TDoS attack, including terminating calls, routing calls to other PSAPs, adjusting queues, and changing call taker behavior. We hope use of this Modeling Tool will encourage 9-1-1 networks to deploy our Orchestra One and PolicyGuru solutions to detect and mitigate TDoS attacks. The Modeling Tool will include a Network Definition, a Call Generator, a Call Simulator, an enhanced Orchestra one solution, and the Intrado ECaTS dashboard for visualization. The solution will use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for all communications, which will allow use of open source software such as Asterisk, which balances fidelity with simplicity. Use of SIP also allows the Modeling Tool to interact with real networks for active call taker training.
