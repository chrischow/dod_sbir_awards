ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite (ADSSS) for MK-99 FCS
=========================================================

# Abstract


The proposed program will extend the capabilities of the ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite (ADSSS), previously developed under the SBIR program, to the MK 99 Fire Control System on Aegis platforms. ADSSS will provide real-time monitoring of "leading indicator" maintenance data on the MK 99, and will post-process this data using a combination of big data analytics and model-based prognostics to support predictive maintenance of the target system, including estimates of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of key components. A prototype ADSSS system for the MK 99 will be developed, tested and used to acquire live data from a MK 99 system. Post-processing of historical, synthetic and live data will be conducted to optimize prognostics algorithms.
