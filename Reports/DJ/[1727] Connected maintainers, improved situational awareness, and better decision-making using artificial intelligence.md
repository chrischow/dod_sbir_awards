Connected maintainers, improved situational awareness, and better decision-making using artificial intelligence
===============================================================================================================

# Abstract


Maintenance events are a fact of life in aviation - and it’s hard to make the right operational decision with stale or partial data.    We propose investigating the utility of SynapseMX, our existing real-time, mobile-enabled maintenance execution platform, to 1) support the Air Force’s mission to fly, fight and win in air, space and cyberspace, 2) improve the visibility of unscheduled maintenance while streamlining team workflows, and 3) provide live insights using artificial intelligence to make better decisions quicker. We believe there is merit in our platform to help modernize as part of the “Base of the Future” initiative.   SynapseMX provides more relevant, more useful, and more trackable information during maintenance execution than existing maintenance solutions, with a goal of making maintainers, operators, and leadership more efficient in both the line and depot environments.
