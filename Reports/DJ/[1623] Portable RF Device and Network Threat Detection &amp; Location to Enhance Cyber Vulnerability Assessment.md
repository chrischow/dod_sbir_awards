Portable RF Device and Network Threat Detection &amp; Location to Enhance Cyber Vulnerability Assessment
========================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force has squadrons tasked with ensuring that Air Force networks are safe from cyberspace attacks.  Bastille provides systems and tools to 1) provide situational awareness of cyber activity in the radio frequency spectrum and 2) locate and interdict rogue radio frequency devices that may be part of a cyber attack on an Air Force network.  In this program, Bastille will develop tools for Air Force cybersecurity operators to make them more effective at finding and eliminating cybersecurity vulnerabilities. When an unknown device enters a facility or when an authorized device joins an external network, Air Force cyber squadrons need to be immediately notified so that they can interdict the offending device.  Bastille meets this need by using distributed Software Defined Radio (SDR) sensor arrays to detect all RF emitting devices from 60MHz to 6GHz.  Bastille is unique in that it has implemented protocol decoders as field programmable gate array (FPGA) IP cores that can operate in parallel to process the massive amount of RF data present in facilities.  Using patented machine learning technology, Bastille provides operators with a real-time view of all of the RF devices in their space as dots overlaid on a floor plan map of their facility.
