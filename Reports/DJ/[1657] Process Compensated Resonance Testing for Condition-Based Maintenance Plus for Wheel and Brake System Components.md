Process Compensated Resonance Testing for Condition-Based Maintenance Plus for Wheel and Brake System Components
================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Vibrant Corporation proposes to apply a Condition-Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) program based on Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT), a commercially-proven quantitative nondestructive evaluation method, to sustainment of wheel and brake components for DoD aircraft. The DoD bases major wheel and brake overhaul on a fixed schedule rather than an assessment of part condition. Ninety-three percent of Air Force wheels at major overhaul are returned to service with no defects found. The cost and environmental impact of transporting, stripping, inspecting and recoating those 93% may not be necessary if a compelling CBM+ solution, combined with faster, more accurate inspection methods, can be implemented to optimize life management. PCRT offers a 90% reduction in inspection time with an automated, objective result. PCRT requires no part preparation or hazardous waste, and it accurately detects surface and sub-surface defects. PCRT measures the resonance frequencies of a part and analyses them with machine learning tools to determine if a part is acceptable. A CBM+ approach based on PCRT uses component resonance frequency data in concert with operational data from aircraft, like the KC-46 tanker (the pilot application), in a Big Data analysis to make decisions about component serviceability, service interval length, and total service life.
