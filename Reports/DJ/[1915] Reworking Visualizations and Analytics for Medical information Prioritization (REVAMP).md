Reworking Visualizations and Analytics for Medical information Prioritization (REVAMP)
======================================================================================

# Abstract


DoD medical personnel across all levels and systems of care?including doctors, nurses, and combat medics?are becoming inundated with medical data and information. These personnel need systems that help them integrate and reason over this ever-expanding collection of medical information. These systems must provide support to triage, treat, evacuate, and return Warfighters to duty in the most efficient manner possible. To address this need, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Reworking Visualizations and Analytics for Medical information Prioritization (REVAMP), an open and extensible system for medical data analytics and visualization. REVAMP features: (1) a secure software bridge and readily extensible application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data among existing and evolving medical information systems; (2) efficient analytics that create actionable information out of medical data, implemented with Charles River?s proven, open-source Figaro? probabilistic programming environment; and (3) a cross-platform visualization ?mashup? interface to flexibly summarize and present medical information, implemented in the Unity rendering engine for efficient execution and cross-platform deployability. All three of these components are designed to enable rapid modification to adapt to new data sources, analytics, and visualizations as well as evolving medical practice and organizational changes.
