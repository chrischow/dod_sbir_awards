Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force has a current need for an agile, effective, simulation software that can deliver warfare data analytics for decision makers, budget analysts, operations research analysts, and a realistic training platform for pilots and airmen. The current premiere choice software that meets this requirement for AFRL, AFWIC, AMC, and the CIA is called COMMAND Pro Edition (CPE). This project intends to develop and expand this software and capability from a single operator to a multi-operator / multi-player platform that will enable networked use. Global and multi airman interaction will expand the simulation from a one-room operation to a global multi-domain networked simulation capability that will produce unrivaled vetted data analytics. This level of collaboration will produce decision vetted information to shape budgets and CONOP COAs to commanders in the field. This enhanced prediction and training simulation capability clearly meets Idea 1853 Command and Control Operations Simulator App mission needs and applies directly to 9 out of 15 focus areas of this AF193-CSO1 topic. Development innovation includes multi-player, cyber attacks, 64 bit, sensor deployment, energy usage, weather effects, and artificial intelligence.
