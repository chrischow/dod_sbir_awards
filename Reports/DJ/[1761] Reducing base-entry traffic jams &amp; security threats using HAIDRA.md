Reducing base-entry traffic jams &amp; security threats using HAIDRA
====================================================================

# Abstract


Currently, all entry onto USAF & DOD facilities are done via manual inspection of each individual and vehicle by Security Forces and Military Police (SF/MP). A single AFB may have upwards of 15,000 Airmen, contractors, and DOD civilians attempting to get on-base during the early hours of the morning. Additionally, exposure to extremely hot environments, freezing temperatures, and repetitive task orders, would leave SF/MP Airmen ill-equipped to do their jobs effectively, which can lead to security lapses. Daily wear-and-tear of Security Forces Airmen who carry an additional 50 lbs. of equipment is often overlooked. Heat exhaustion is commonplace from the manual inspection process. Litocorp seeks to augment the base-entry processing with Human-Machine Teaming technology. By leveraging existing Open-Source Software Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technology in Facial Recognition, Machine Learning, and Predictive Analytics to deliver a platform for Pattern-of-Life vehicle analytics & user analysis, integrated with Defense Biometric IDentification System (DBIDS). Litocorp respectfully introduces HAIDRA: Hardware Assisted Identification of Drivers for Readiness and Agility (TRL 3)
