Interoperable sUAS Autonomy for the Air Force
=============================================

# Abstract


KEF Robotics is developing an interoperable â€˜autonomy subsystemâ€™ for small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS): a computer and software-based â€œpilotâ€, which could be attached to an aircraft and provide hazard detection and avoidance, navigation, and guidance in complex battlefield environments. The autonomy system, which would interface with an sUASâ€™s onboard computer and autopilot, could take over the control of the aircraft to relieve a human pilot, or provide autonomous flight in instances where communication between a human pilot is lost. Providing autonomy through an attachable subsystem will reduce sUAS costs and complexity, while reducing the time to market and ensuring the highest quality autonomy can be fielded on a continual basis. Interoperable autonomy solutions will lead the sUAS marketplace into a new era of competitiveness and innovation, reducing Air Force procurement costs and increasing the modernity of the sUAS fleet. KEF robotics was the top team in qualifying for Lockheed Martin's AlphaPilot, an autonomous drone racing challenge, and already has a DOD customer for our autonomy solution. This proposal is aligned with Focus Area 14 (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Dual Use Technologies), especially the need for â€œAutonomyâ€, â€œcommand and control of air vehiclesâ€, â€œSense and Avoid architecturesâ€.
