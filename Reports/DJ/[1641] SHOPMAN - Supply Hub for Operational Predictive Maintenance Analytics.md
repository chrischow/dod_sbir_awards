SHOPMAN: Supply Hub for Operational Predictive Maintenance Analytics
====================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Forceâ€™s ability to collect, store, and process raw maintenance and inventory data continues to exceed its ability to effectively process it. Given the USAF stakeholder-identified challenges of interfacing with dated information systems and using available personnel efficiently, Colvin Run Networks Inc. proposes a specific configuration of its commercial machine-learning-enabled predictive maintenance and inventory management (PMIM) enhancement solution, called SHOPMAN: the Supply Hub for Operational Predictive Maintenance Analytics.
