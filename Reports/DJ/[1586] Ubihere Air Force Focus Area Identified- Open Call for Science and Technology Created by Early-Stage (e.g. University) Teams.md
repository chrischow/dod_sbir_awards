Ubihere Air Force Focus Area Identified- Open Call for Science and Technology Created by Early-Stage (e.g. University) Teams
============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


UbiHere, a Columbus Ohio based small business, has developed, in conjunction with The Ohio State University, a unique highly capable low-cost system to address the known issues with GPS denied tracking of assets, equipment or people in indoor and outdoor operating environments. UbiHereâ€™s commercial system is comprised of an application specific electronics tag, designed by the company, which utilizes a suite of high precision commercial sensors to provide real-time data to an onboard machine learning and artificial intelligence software system. This location and tracking tag solution accesses on-board or network accessible high fidelity geo-registered digital datasets to process, analyze, learn and correct the movement information provided by the sensors to refine and correct the position of the tag to a â€œtrueâ€� location comparable to that provided by GPS systems. Given the technologyâ€™s unique combination of low-cost, high-accuracy, long battery life and operational capability, the UbiHere system has the potential to transform the Air Forceâ€™s ability to operate effectively in any GPS denied environment. The system has been tested for indoor commercial applications but has the potential to provide outdoor location and tracking of vehicles, Airmen and other assets in GPS contested environments. This is particularly true for Air Force special
