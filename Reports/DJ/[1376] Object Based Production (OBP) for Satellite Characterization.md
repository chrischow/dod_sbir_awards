Object Based Production (OBP) for Satellite Characterization
============================================================

# Abstract


The Expedition Technology team proposes, the Object-based Satellite Characterization, Analysis, and Reporting (OSCAR) program to addresses the goals of providing a robust framework for near real-time processing of a broad and growing set of sensor data for space situational awareness, and object characterization. We will integrate proven modern algorithms for characterization and fingerprinting in various phenomenologies utilizing a proven EO data processing chain and a novel SIGINT characterization algorithm. This system will demonstrate the viability to automatically classify by type, origin, function, and behavior. Modern machine learning algorithms will be employed for clustering, classification, and normality modeling, providing a robust trigger for Indications and Warning systems. In addition, proven algorithms and data structures will provide a foundation for detecting potential threats to US space systems. Our framework builds upon an understanding of the ongoing developments in multi-source intelligence for Object Based Production within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.
