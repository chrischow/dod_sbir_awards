Microstructure-Informed Rapid Qualification of Turbine Engine Blades
====================================================================

# Abstract


Microstructure-informed, stochastic fatigue life prediction models are low cost, fast, and material agnostic tools that can help optimize the design and use efficienct of short-life turbine enginesby enabling designers to maximize the potential of blade materials under strenuousrotational speeds and high temperature loading conditions.As a microstructure-informatics company with a proven record in using data analytics to develop material behavior prediction models, MRL is proposing a low-cost microstructure informed HCF life prediction methodology that is expected to provide designers with fast probabilistic high-cycle lifing model using low cost statistical quantification of material discontinuities.Experimental cost reduction will also be achieved through the incorporation of novel testing methodologies and design of experiments.
