Automating Air Travel Safety Analysis with AI-Driven Machines
=============================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force (AF) Operations Support Squadrons (OSS), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Air Operations Centers (AOC), seeks a strong partner to automate risk and threat intelligence forecasts to attain the goals of the evolving future warfare and to transform analytical capabilities. Geospark Analytics looks forward to continue to build the force of the future and building upon the significant milestones it has already reached to bring users to the next level of actionable intelligence. Only Geospark Analytics' Hyperion can offer artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that automate risk and threat intelligence forecasts. Using publicly available information (PAI) from news, social media, open government and NGO sources, Hyperionâ€™s applied machine learning (ML) models are continually assessing risk and activity at the global, country, region, and city levels in near real-time. Our Phase II objective will implement and extend Hyperion with aero-specific content and customized ML-modeling, has direct applicability to AF operations and intelligence missions.
