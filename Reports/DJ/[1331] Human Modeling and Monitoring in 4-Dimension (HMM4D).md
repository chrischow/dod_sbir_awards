Human Modeling and Monitoring in 4-Dimension (HMM4D)
====================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT:  In Phase II, Infoscitex will focus on developing an innovative, robust, and efficient software system, HMM4D, which utilizes a dynamic 3-D human model to detect human threats and to predict human intention. In Phase I, we have achieved major accomplishments and findings on 3-D motion replication, dynamic shape description and analysis, and activity recognition based on shape dynamics. We renovated the original concept of HMM4D by making full use of information coded in dynamic models. In Phase II, we will continue technology development and implementation, software development, and case studies. Specifically, we will work on (a) shape analysis and anomaly detection; (b) 3-D motion analysis and activity recognition; (c) 3-D shape dynamics and activity recognition; (d) information fusion and decision making; (e) 3-D motion replication and animation; and (f) system integration, testing, and evaluation. Upon the completion of Phase II efforts, we will create a fully functional software toolthe first version of HMM4D, which is ready for technology transition and commercialization in Phase III. We have established a talented team for this project consisting of senior engineers from Infoscitex, with vast knowledge of and experience in human modeling, computer vision, machine learning and pattern recognition, and software development.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits: Our technology will provide a creative yet robust solution to the Topic and will offer the following benefits:     HMM4D makes full use of the information coded in a dynamic 3-D model by extracting the information of shape, motion, and shape dynamics from it. This increases the robustness of the system and provides wide flexibility to adapt to various real world scenarios.        HMM4D fuses the information and clues from shape, motion, and shape dynamics in the stage of decision making, which substantially increases the discriminating capability and accuracy of the system.   HMM4D provides a function for 3-D motion replication, which can be used in virtual reality creation or as a test bed for system performance evaluation.    HMM4D maximizes the potential uses of the information provided by multi-modality sensor data so that it can function effectively and reliably in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environment conditions.      The HMM4D is designed to have an open structure that is adaptable to the development of sensor technology and human modeling technology. The interface with the supporting database and the retrieval and fusion of information are designed to be scalable so that large datasets can be used when they become available.    Anticipated Defense and Commercial Applications  This technology will have very broad applications in both military and commercial sectors.    As a key technology for human threat detection and intention prediction;    For war fighters to efficiently identify enemies from a crowd;   As a screening tool for the security surveillance of public facilities;   For human search and rescue;   For virtual reality creation and entertainment industry to create bio-fidelic human figures.
