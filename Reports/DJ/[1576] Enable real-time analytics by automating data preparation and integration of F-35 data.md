Enable real-time analytics by automating data preparation and integration of F-35 data
======================================================================================

# Abstract


Organizations are investing in AI and data analytics to make faster decisions and predictions using data they collect from sensors, machines, logs, radar, meteorological, and other real-world devices. However, data complexity kills most of these projects due to manual data integration, rigid input and models, and closed architectures that are currently used to solve these. Sentenai enables agile decision-making by generating actionable insight from operational data. Our approach gives you a complete view of all your systems through our data virtualization platform. Instead of relying on manual data integration and rigid analytical models, Sentenai automates data integration and provides AI-powered data fusion for continuous analysis. Sentenai is a spatio-temporal data analysis platform that uses data fusion, artificial intelligence, and machine-learning to provide data analysts with rapid insight into complex system behavior through pattern recognition, entity classification, and on-demand data fusion. Our technology unifies heterogeneous event data from disparate data sources using unsupervised machine learning models for schema detection. Sentenai's open analytics architecture ensures interoperability between data collected from various sources and end-user analysis applications by virtualizing the data structures and automatically performing data transformations to support analytical data source definitions, integrations, and visualizations.
