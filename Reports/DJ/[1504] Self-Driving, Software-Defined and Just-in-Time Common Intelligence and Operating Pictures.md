Self-Driving, Software-Defined and Just-in-Time Common Intelligence and Operating Pictures
==========================================================================================

# Abstract


Demonstrate the feasibility of creating self-driving, software-defined and just-in-time smart Common Intelligence and Operating pictures at run-time for significantly enhanced decision making efficiency, leveraging data analytics, machine learning, automation, and dynamic, just-in-time user interface generation, navigation and continuous displays. Similar to self-driving car, the self-driving intelligence and operating pictures creates run-time self-adaptive dynamic visualizations and just-in-time composite operating pictures, automatically display, navigate, fine-tune and highlight the most relevant intelligence insights on the screen (â€œGPS on steroidâ€�) for optimal human-machine teaming. It can also prompt or trigger actions at run-time., and allow user to take over the control on-demand.
