AI / Machine Learning Rapid, Dynamic Incident Response Solution for Integrated Base Defense
===========================================================================================

# Abstract


During a Base security incident, decision makers and responders require the right information at the right time. Interpreting data streams from numerous different security systems, understanding a continuously changing risk assessment, and achieving situational awareness with incomplete or inaccurate information can lead to incorrect immediate action and delays when seconds count. This proposal improves command response by using machine learning to inform response plans in real time. The proposed AVERT® AI solution is based upon proven and commercially available technologies.  These systems will be configured to provide BDOC operators, first responders, and Commanders the real time decision information required to improve responses during critical incidents. The AVERT AI solution is enabled by the CORE® Machine Learning technology, an adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network that mimics short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory captures the details of the unfolding threat and compares the information to past threats in long-term memory to determine an appropriate response.
