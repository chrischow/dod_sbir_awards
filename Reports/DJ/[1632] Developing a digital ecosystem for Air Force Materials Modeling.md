Developing a digital ecosystem for Air Force Materials Modeling
===============================================================

# Abstract


Ever-increasing Air Force materials requirements, combined with the advent of machine learning, and availability of materials databases, pose a need to understand and exploit these methods for acceleration of the materials/manufacturing lifecycle. The proposal will provide cost-effective and easy-to-use digital tools and services that facilitate and accelerate the analysis, organization, retrieval, sharing, and modeling of complex data in the domain of advanced materials through the use of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques.
