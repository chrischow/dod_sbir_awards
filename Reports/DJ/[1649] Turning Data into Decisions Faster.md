Turning Data into Decisions Faster
==================================

# Abstract


TeamWorx Security seeks to employ our automation, machine learning (ML), and intelligent workflow technology to increase the efficiency, speed, and accuracy of the test execution process. TeamWorx Security will configure our user interface (UI), data ingestion, and correlation technology to automate the test generation workflow, correlate disparate data across formats, repositories, and sensors, enable visual identification and manipulation of correlated data, and create baselines that could enable automatic identification of anomalies.
