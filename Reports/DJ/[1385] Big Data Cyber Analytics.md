Big Data Cyber Analytics
========================

# Abstract


Vlabs will define an architecture for a big data cybersecurity solution that will provide a real-time, intuitive and actionable analytics for enhanced situational awareness and rapid response. The system will facilitate automation of key security decisions with a goal to accelerate the attack detection time of highly resourceful adversaries. The system will ingest and analyze various data types and sources such as tickets, alerts, user accounts, performance monitoring, and a variety of document formats.  The solution will maximize the value extracted from every piece of evidence available in the scalable data lake. Vlabs is well positioned to perform this work from the extensive experience in big data analytics and the broad spectrum of cybersecurity technologies.
