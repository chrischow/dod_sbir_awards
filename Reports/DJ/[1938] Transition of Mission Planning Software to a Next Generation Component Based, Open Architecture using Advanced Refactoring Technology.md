Transition of Mission Planning Software to a Next Generation Component Based, Open Architecture using Advanced Refactoring Technology
=====================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


IDTs flexible and self-healing Next-Generation Open Architecture (NGOA) will unlock the potential of the mission planning system requirements via an innovative data architecture. Artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning systems will then be able to use this data in an evolving environment to build, optimize, and deconflict single or multi-agent mission plans in real-time. Transition of the existing mission planning code base to the NGOA will be accomplished via an advanced software refactoring approach. This approach extracts information from the existing code base to build a model-based highly automated transition plan to move the code base from the existing representation to the Next-Generation Open Architecture, enhancing the code during the transition.
