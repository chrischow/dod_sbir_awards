Theater Multi-Mission Planner
=============================

# Abstract


Navy TASWCs face increasing operational demands with fewer platforms, more challenging targets, and more capable threats.This creates a difficult resource allocation problem inside a tightly coupled and labor intensive planning process.Coupled with complex risk assessment largely based on planner heuristics, this situation is a recipe for overloaded planners, hastily cobbled together plans, limited exploration of alternative Courses of Action (COAs), and poor risk assessment.The main goal of this SBIR proposal is to develop a set of tools that will assist planners to better explore the operational design trade-space and assess risk in candidate COAs, with the goal of achieving the best possible allocation of resources to missions.Sonalysts proposes to leverage TASW planners expert knowledge by combining multi-objective optimization with Fuzzy Logic (FL) tools using a proprietary machine learning method that will be implemented in an automated risk assessment and resource allocation TASW planning tool.Automation of complex resource allocation and providing a transparent risk assessment tool can free TASW planners attention from the minutia of planning, and allow them to focus more critically on understanding and managing risk and risk performance tradeoffs.This will be the first step in increasing automation in the TASW planning capability.
