Battlefield Space Operations Insight Platform
=============================================

# Abstract


Slingshot Aerospace believes Air Force Space Operators know what capabilities will enhance their ability to fight and win in the increasingly contested, congested and degraded space environment. For phase 1, Slingshot Aerospace will apply its expertise in advanced data analytics and visualization to work directly with the 460th Space Wing to assess the feasibility of adapting Slingshotâ€™s commercial Space Situational Awareness Platform, Orbital Atlas, to augment the 460thâ€™s unique mission to deliver global infrared surveillance, tracking and missile warning for theater and homeland defense. Recent advances in automated processing and artificial intelligence led to significant advancements in the ability for computers to augment operators ability to investigate large amounts of complex data and rapidly respond to threats. By leveraging Orbital Atlas, Slingshot can rapidly enhance the 460thâ€™s capabilities by providing a timely tactical situational awareness platform to decrease space warfighterâ€™s burdensome human-in-the-loop analysis while supporting Combatant Commands across the globe.
