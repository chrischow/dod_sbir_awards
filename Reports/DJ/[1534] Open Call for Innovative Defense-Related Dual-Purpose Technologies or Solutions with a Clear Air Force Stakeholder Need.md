====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Mental health issues and suicide continue to plague the Air Force community as well as other military branches. While many programs work to solve this issue, few gather deep 360 degree patient data, provide 24/7 peer support, or utilize artificial intelligence for predictive analytics. SameGrainâ€™s proposed mobile app solution can be personalized to meet the Air Forceâ€™s specific data objectives while also providing an overall community platform to connect peers for ongoing support. As the platformâ€™s intelligence grows, mental health solutions can be fine-tuned to increase knowledge and success rates. SameGrain has an existing award winning mobile iOS app that leverages millions of match points to intelligently and privately connect consumers for multiple use cases. Match recommendations are derived from hundreds of proprietary questions, thousands of attributes from existing profiles, and millions of topics. The more data users provide the deeper and more relevant their matches become. Currently, the average user provide 116 answers, the top third of provide over 300.
