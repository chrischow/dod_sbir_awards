RECURRING TRAINING VIRTUAL REALITY (RT VR)
==========================================

# Abstract


Recurring Training Virtual Reality (RT VR) is a cloud-based, lesson deployment system that allows operators to complete non-classified Event IDs in virtual reality headsets to fulfill qualification requirements for recurring training. Program will be designed for the Twentieth Air Force. This light-weight virtual reality training system can have applications across the Air Force where limited instructor/classroom time or access to physical locations results in delays to airmen acquiring qualifications. This program will leverage VR technology and training systems being used by top consulting firms in the private sector to develop a customized, turn key solution designed specifically for Air Force recurring training task IDs. VR training can accelerate current systems and increase training opportunities by focusing on non-classified Task IDs, allowing airmen and trainers to spend more time on high priority, classified training during MCCO trainer time. This program comes with embedded machine learning that can track a studentâ€™s progress to create a safe record documenting completed and outstanding Event IDs. Innovative training will provide increased training with measurable effectiveness that will save costs and appeal to next generation airmen.
