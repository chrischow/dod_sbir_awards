Automated Analysis of Combat Systems Software
=============================================

# Abstract


Heureka will develop and integrate powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the Aegis defect management process. These tools will vastly improve Aegis operational readiness and save at least $7M per year in program costs. Two new tools will be developed. An AI-based tool called TurboTOR will meet critical needs identified during Phase I for improving change request specificity and reducing duplicate Trouble Observation Reports (TORs). In effect, it provides a virtual software developer to the tester to help tease out intricacies of an observed defect. The AI-based Replicate Prioritization Decisions (RAPID) tool maps Computer Program Change Requests (CPCRs) to specifications, determines baseline applicability, and estimates change request adjudication parameters. The tools will be integrated within the Aegis Combat Systems Engineering Agent’s (CSEA’s; Lockheed Martin) and the Navy’s operational environments. Lockheed Martin is a significant teaming partner and will provide over a thousand hours of guidance from seven element leads (ADS, CND, WCS, etc…), ClearQuest, DOORS and ACCESS integrators, and CSEDS testers. This intensive integration provides a springboard for Phase II Navy integration and evaluation at IWSL, SCSC, and other facilities. CSEDS and Navy feedback throughout Phase II will be used to continually improve the tools.
