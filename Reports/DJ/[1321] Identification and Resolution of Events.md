# Abstract


ABSTRACT:The Air Force has a need to maintain strong intelligence capability in semi-permissive and anti-access area denial (A2/AD) scenarios where full-motion video (FMV)-based surveillance assets are rare or unavailable. In such environments, priority is given to leveraging any and all other sources of intelligence available, which may include ?open sources? of data available on the public Web, including social media platforms, both domestic and international.    Intuidex, Inc. proposes to support enhanced intelligence capability in A2/AD through research, development and transition of an improved data analytics framework. The framework will (1) incorporate open source intelligence (OSINT) sources; (2) enhance entity resolution (ER) algorithms to operate across all applied data sources, including social media; (3) visualize the multi-intelligence fused, resolved data in both desktop and mobile modalities; (4) advance the state of the art in information extraction on microtext ?chat? data; and (5) expose programmatic application program interfaces (APIs) to encourage system integration of the entity resolution capability with other Air Force acquisitions.BENEFIT:Anticipated benefits include contributions to the state of the art in entity resolution, specifically leveraging ?chat?-like sources, and therefore improvement to downstream analyst production directly and through integrated toolsets.  Commercial application includes opportunities to transition into current and future data analytics products on the market, including those supporting Law Enforcement and domestic investigations.
