Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need

# Abstract


Falkonry LRS is your â€œData Scientist in a Box,â€� pre-packaged operational machine learning (ML) empowers your teams with pattern discovery, predictive analytics and explanation to improve uptime, performance, quality and safety. Falkonry believes its AI-enabled LRS could add significant value to the processing of electronic intelligence (ELINT) data, at scale and for significantly lower cost. We propose to pilot this in both unclassified and classified Air Force and joint DoD units, with the Joint Warfare Analysis Center in STRATCOM as our lead customer. The target user is the operations/intelligence analyst. The analyst has access to large amounts of operational and other electronic signal data coming from sensors and other forms of instrumentation. The technical challenge is to exploit that data in order to get early warning of adverse events, detect anomalies, and provide some level of confidence and explanation of why the analyst reached a particular judgment. By combining the analystâ€™s subject-matter expertise with Falkonryâ€™s automated ability to â€œseeâ€� patterns in complex signal data, the analyst can create, test and validate predictive models that perform more accurate prediction and provide transparency into how confident the system is and explanation of which signals are most highly correlated with a particular judgment.
