Semi-Autonomous Multi-Agent System for Wide Area Threat Detection
=================================================================

# Abstract


Incorporate existing sensor technologies in a modular fashion onto a ground-based mobile platform directed by a back-end data processing system using artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms. This provides a multisensory system with the ability for adaptive sensor node relocation as environment conditions change and the determination of hostile intent based on historical and collected data.
