Model Based Systems Engineering Big Data Analytics
==================================================

# Abstract


In this Phase II project, WW Technology Group (WWTG) will develop a scalable and powerful framework and foundation for Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) supported by Big Data in a streamlined software toolchain. The approach uses an established front end that can consume a wide variety of data types and formats found in engineering documents. A series of Big Data analytic methods are used to reduce the information into a meta database. Advanced techniques are introduced to enhance the structure and mapping of this metadata for use in a unified MBSE system model. WWTG tools are then used to manage and display the unified model and perform Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The methods will enable development of knowledge structures and mappings to obtain the highest quality information for seeding designs, development of capabilities, and efficient system integration. Fully developed, the new system will facilitate the use of substantial prior knowledge from the vast collection of documentation provided to and generated by the Government through years of system acquisition and sustainment to improve new system designs. The capabilities can be readily integrated with existing DoD processes and capabilities.
