Real-Time Cellular, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Device &amp; Intrusion Detection for AFTAC
==================================================================================

# Abstract


Radio Frequency (RF) devices in secure facilities significantly expand an organization’s cyber-security attack surface.  By communicating with external networks from inside secure areas, unauthorized RF devices can act as a conduit for data and audio exfiltration, as well as a jumping-off point for in-bound cyber-attacks.  It is critical for Air Force and DoD organizations to have a tool to detect and monitor RF devices on a variety of protocols that operate within their facilities. When an unknown device enters a facility or when an authorized device joins an external network, facility security needs to be immediately notified so that they can interdict the offending device.  Bastille meets this need by using distributed Software Defined Radio (SDR) sensor arrays to detect all RF emitting devices from 60MHz to 6GHz.  Bastille is unique in that it has implemented protocol decoders as field programmable gate array (FPGA) IP cores that can operate in parallel to process the massive amount of RF data present in facilities.  Using patented machine learning technology, Bastille provides operators with a real-time view of all of the RF devices in their space as dots overlaid on a floor plan map of their facility.
