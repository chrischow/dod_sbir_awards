HALO: Software that Enables COTS Drones to Navigate Autonomously in GPS-Denied Environments
===========================================================================================

# Abstract


Third Insight has developed a plug-and-play software platform called â€œHALOâ€Â that gives commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) drones the ability to navigate autonomously in GPS-denied environments. HALO is a light-weight 3D computer vision and machine learning application that can be installed on-board COTS drones (for full autonomy) or on mobile devices or computers that are connected to the drone via remote control. Operating in GPS-denied environments is critical not just for defense, but also for commercial customers in the airline, insurance, construction, and other markets, who have an urgent need to fly UAVs indoors and in cluttered, outdoor spaces where GPS may not be available. Letters of Support are included from AFCENT, who has selected Third Insight's HALO platform as a potential solution to address USAF urgent needs during forward deployment. AFCENT has identified key customer discovery requirements that Third Insight would accomplish within this Phase I SBIR. HALO is a dual-purpose technology that Third Insight is developing for USAF and commercial UAV-based aircraft inspection markets. Letters of Support are also included from Two-Star General Dawn Ferrel and Third Insight's commercial partner, Flatirons Solutions, who are providing complementary support to this SBIR through other contracts.
