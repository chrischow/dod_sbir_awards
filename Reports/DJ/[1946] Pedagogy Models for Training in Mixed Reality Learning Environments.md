Pedagogy Models for Training in Mixed Reality Learning Environments
===================================================================

# Abstract


This effort will develop, demonstrate, and validate pedagogical models for training maintenance and troubleshooting in mixed reality (MR) environments., providing the concept and design for a for a software tool to design and assess MR training solutions: the Mixed Realty Training Tool (MRTT). The approach will develop an elaborated version of Guided Experiential Learning principles for pedagogical models focused on learning maintenance and troubleshooting of complex systems, utilizing machine learning algorithms. Simulation-based assessments will inform student models utilized by an intelligent tutoring system..
