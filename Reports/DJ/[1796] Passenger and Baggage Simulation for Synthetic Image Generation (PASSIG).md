Passenger and Baggage Simulation for Synthetic Image Generation (PASSIG)
========================================================================

# Abstract


Innovision LLC proposes an innovative and robust solution to this topic, a software tool named PASSIG (Passenger and Baggage Simulation for Synthetic Image Generation), which can be used to quickly create 3D passenger models and baggage models. These models, in turn, can be used by electromagnetic simulation (EMS) tools to generate synthetic passenger and baggage Xray and MMV images for machine learning training. We will explore and evaluate relevant technologies and tools used for EMS and then define appropriate requirements for PASSIG. We will design unique data structure for object models and develop innovative methods and algorithms for passenger configuration and baggage configuration. We will build a model warehouse to collect various human models and object models representing stream of commerce. We will implement advanced software engineering to construct PASSIG. As such, PASSIG will become an efficient and robust software tool for passenger and baggage simulation, with the capability to create large number of passenger models and baggage models at fast speed. The 3D passenger models and baggage models created by PASSIG will be compatible with the basic requirements for EMS. PASSIG can be used independently or integrated with existing or new EMS software packages. PASSIG can also be used for multimodal sensor simulation, autonomous driving simulation, and human centric product development.
