Embedded Space Analytics
========================

# Abstract


Navy needs a real-time graph embedding tool for analyzing huge graphs (millions of nodes and billions of edges) from diverse sources. However, current approaches cannot provide dynamic and scalable graph analytics to show the military value of tactical data. In this project, InfoBeyond advocates EStreaming (Embedding & Streaming) for scalable and efficient graph streaming. EStreaming promotes big data streaming technology where unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms can be conducted over the streaming platform. It can split a huge graph into small subgraphs such that distributed graph embedding can be conducted in parallel among a set of processors. Meanwhile, the graph embedding can be effectively merged and visualized. Considering the diversity of Navy applications, EStreaming is an open platform that can implement many graph embedding algorithms such as IsoMap, LLE, Laplacian eigenmap, and graph factorizations. We have demonstrated the implementation of Distributed LINE (DLINE) and Distributed MVE (DMVE). Compared to other algorithms, classification of DLINE can be conducted from the internal relations and the similarity among the persons in the solider, enemy, and other social networks. Differently, DMVE can be used for analyzing spatial - temporal data such as for ISR sensor networks, e.g., Navy ISR geographic traffic monitoring.
