Design of Quantum Circuits with Error Correction
================================================

# Abstract


Phase I will identify and design code concepts for protection of qubits and entangled pairs.  Machine Learning will be used to generate efficient codes, including effects of noise and circuit layout. Optimal computing “paths” will be explored. The project will use using commercially available CPU/GPU machines using open source software. These will then be applied to sequences of circuit segments and evaluated on the IBM quantum computers utilized by AFRL/RITQ.
