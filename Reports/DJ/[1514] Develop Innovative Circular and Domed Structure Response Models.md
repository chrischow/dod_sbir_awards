Develop Innovative Circular and Domed Structure Response Models
===============================================================

# Abstract


While fast running models (FRMs) have been developed for rectangular structures and flat structural components, there are no FRMs for non-rectangular structures, such as domes, arches, and missile silos, which are unique in their design and in their response to weapons effects. An FRM for a domed or curved structure must represent the entire structureâ€™s response, not just the components. Successful FRMs for these curved structures must also account for the geometry, to predict the loads, structural response, localized damage, and residual capacity of the structure. The FRM must be accurate and fast-running, capable of integration into existing lethality/vulnerability codes. To develop successful FRMs for circular and domed structures, Protection Engineering Consultants (PEC) has teamed with Applied Simulations, Inc (ASI). In a separate AFRL SBIR Phase II project, PEC is currently developing a new paradigm for the creation of FRMs through application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, coupled with the laws of physics. ASI develops and applies state-of-the-art numerical modeling tools for weapon-target interaction. Together, we will demonstrate the quality of the numerical simulations that are performed by ASI and we will build a robust and accurate FRM.
