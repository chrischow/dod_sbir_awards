Direct to Phase II Open Topic: Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
===================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Kana Systems proposes leveraging the Actionable Analytics platform with the Air Force-approved Unified Data Library (UDL) to monitor assets and infrastructure of USSTRATCOMâ€™s Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications enterprise (NEC). Actionable Analytics is a web-based customized data and software solution, combining data governance and visualization with machine learning to deliver near-real time information and analytics. The commercial version of Actionable Analytics has had success helping businesses and organizations to make more informed operating and marketing decisions based on relevant analytics. These technologies are matured commercially to an appropriate Technical Readiness Level (TRL) to explore the benefits that may flow to defense customers like USSTRATCOM and the NEC. The goal at the completion of Phase II is to be at a TRL 7, after the development of an operational prototype. Actionable Analytics subscribers may view updated asset reporting and probable failure rate predictions through a clean, intuitive dashboard. Implementing Actionable Analyticsâ€™ advanced data analytics and data visualization will support NC3 operations by improving situational awareness and decision-making for Americaâ€™s warfighters and leaders.
