Ecosystem of Analytics via Massive Multi-analyst Multi-domain Analytics Laboratory (M3AL)
=========================================================================================

# Abstract


Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to build an ecosystem of analytics via a common platform. The technological foundation is a massive multi-analyst multi-domain analytics laboratory (M3AL) that models analyst interactions as an ecosystem platform beyond just an aggregator tool. The ecosystem of analytics is a unified, cross-domain experimentation platform for multiple analytics that will be used to identify causalities among variables across domains, predict tool evolution and survival, analyze analyst behavior and reproduce results. We will develop the novel analytics ecosystem M3AL to discover and recommend the most relevant analytics (across domains) mapped to different missions tasks. M3AL will produce a real world network of analytics and apply advanced machine learning and graph analysis techniques to automatically select the most suitable tool or set of tools from this network for a mission within the given domain. We will first develop a stack of analytics categories. Then, we will build an analytics ecosystem platform tunable in terms of frequency of usage, description and controlled variables representative of these analytics. As output, it will generate a set of causalities among analytics and their variables, analytics performance, analytics description, analytics tags (explicit or hidden), and underlying mechanisms to assure effective mission tasking.
