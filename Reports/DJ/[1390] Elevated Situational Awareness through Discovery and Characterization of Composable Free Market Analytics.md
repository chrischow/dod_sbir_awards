Elevated Situational Awareness through Discovery and Characterization of Composable Free Market Analytics

# Abstract


Securboration proposes to design and build the prototype, Reusable Analytics in a Data Lake Environment (RAiDLE), a platform from which the power of big data analytics can be unleashed across agencies and domains in a secure and modular manner in a data lake environment. Valuable insights from big data tends to be siloed currently, because the analytics performed are too domain/agency specific and the data sets that they operate upon are not interoperable. The challenges underlying this SBIR project are to evolve the metadata specifications for analytics in such a manner that the analytics is discoverable and portable across multiple domains through smart orchestration. We will augment the metadata associated with existing COTS and GOTS analytical tools being used for UTC, TRANSCOM and DTIC data repositories with the necessary extensions to be able to address interoperability of tools as well as provide valuable data science insights. The orchestration layer, guided through smart metadata, will match analytical goals with the right tools and datasets obviating the need for users to have training in statistical analysis, business intelligence or data mining. End users should be able to make decisions based on their high-level queries thus freeing up their time to focus on
