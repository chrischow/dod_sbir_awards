Next Generation Data Base Modeled on Human Neurological Processes
=================================================================

# Abstract


The innovations to be researched consist of identifying and documenting key application design elements and architectural components necessary to develop an advanced next generation database model. This database is a neurologically inspired design based on data cell and link cell interactions to support new and unique advanced data analysis, new methods for entity relationship association, semantic mapping and associative search capabilities. The database is intended to support both structured and unstructured data. In response Infobionics will propose the Cellular Database design as an elegantly simpler solution for managing complex structured and unstructured data, with the ability to make data model changes as required by the application with minimal effort. It offers new possibilities for easy and more powerful searches to discover information and knowledge in more natural ways. The cellular database combines metadata and raw data in such a way as to offer the most flexible model available. This database technology is fully backward compatible with current relational databases, while supporting a new set of storage, access and search capabilities. Last, the data base can support the emerging data management capabilities based on some of the ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘semantic network’ concepts.
