Diagnostic Engine for Cognitive Improvement and Decision Effectiveness (DECIDE)
===============================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is for continued development of the Diagnostic Engine for Cognitive Improvement and Decision Effectiveness (DECIDE). NAVSEA IWS has sponsored the creation of the DECIDE Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool to augment the ability of observers of training and certification exercises to more rapidly, accurately, and efficiently assess individual and team performance in mission critical tasks. DECIDE will adaptively direct evaluator attention to performance issues of greatest importance in confirming qualification with respect to standards, will embed those standards into real time performance criteria satisfaction decision making, and will maintain a running aggregate competency/qualification appraisal for support of interim or post exercise feedback on demand. All of this capability is packaged for use in the tactical environmentshore based or in combat spaces aboard ship, while at rest or underway. In this proposal, we offer continuing development of the most important enhancements that advance DECIDE to the state of maturity where it will be ready for test and evaluation in the operational environment by its intended users. We also propose collaboration with the 3rd Fleet ATG that has been suggested as the test organization to prepare the tool for their evaluation, train the users, and assist as needed.TBD
