Proactive Predictive Machine Maintenance (P2M2)
===============================================

# Abstract


Complex relationships between power system components and utilization equipment require large amounts of measurement points along the service train and estimation of service capability. In the past, false alarms, missed failures, mishandled preventive maintenance scheduling, and underutilized resources have resulted in poor operational performance. Recent advances in information systems technology allow intelligent monitoring of these many measurement points. Emerging capabilities are partial recovery, forecast of impending problems, and increased operational use during abnormal operations. What is needed is an automated health monitoring capability for electric machinery and systems that have high fault detection, and low false alarm. Additionally, the capability performs “self-healing” functions to reduce down time of electrical machinery. The team of 21st Century Systems Incorporated and the University of Missouri is pleased to propose the development of a tool that will provide the automated health monitoring and self-healing capability and decision support necessary to improve the survivability of our Naval vessels.  We call our Phase I concept Proactive Predictive Machine Maintenance (P2M2). We will be leveraging existing work in health monitoring and embedded systems techniques combined with cutting edge research into advanced sensor design and intelligent computing to design a Fault Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Self-Healing Control system.BENEFITS: The list of potential military applications for these capabilities is quite long. The 21CSI team fully intends to build and transition key technological elements; embedded systems, machine learning, CBM technology, etc.; to suitable Navy and DoD large electrical machine systems. 21CSI will build the distributed software, with agents, tailored to the specific applications. Once the prototype agent-based system is reasonably developed (likely, midway through Phase II), we will commence transition. The Navy will be the potential government customer, the P2M2 system will be placed in-line between the sensor and the ship’s monitoring system (ICAS or similar) to monitor, diagnose, predict, and ultimately control Navy electrical machinery. $1.2 M - $1.5M and ~18 months will be required to complete the P2M2 Model development.  The majority of the funding is required for investigating P2M2 user requirements, for building a P2M2 model, and to build a prototype. A modest portion of the necessary funding (~$100K) will come from 21CSI IR&D.  The vast majority will come from Phase II, Phase II Options, and Phase III SBIRs. 21CSI has strong DoD application marketing capabilities due to its market penetration for more than ten years with good contacts and a strong reputation with most SETAs.  In addition, 21CSI has informally spoken with potential customers regarding P2M2 for electrical machinery and learned that the planned capabilities and pricing are very attractive to those potential customers.  Once the system is accredited, 21CSI will launch a campaign to educate DoD, other government agencies, and commercial customers on the capabilities and applications of the P2M2 Prediction Software for electrical machinery. If this technology is proven to be feasible after Phase I and meets requirements at the end of Phase II, it will be transitioned to ONR’s Advanced Integrated Power System (AIPS) program under the Enterprise and Platform Enablers Future Naval Capability (FNC). The technology will be demonstrated 1) in simulation on ONR’s Virtual Test Bed (VTB) and 2) in a full scale medium voltage demonstrator together with global power system management capabilities currently being developed. The commercial customer will be primarily airlines and cruise ship companies. The P2M2 system will help the airlines reduce operating costs and provide timely and required maintenance upon landing. There are currently numerous vendors of each of the key technology components required for developing the Fault Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Self-Healing Control Proactive Predictive Machine Maintenance (P2M2); however, no one is offering a platform independent, COTS-based integrated solution.  21CSI has several dimensions of sustainable competitive advantage for the P2M2 system once development is completed and the system is accredited.
