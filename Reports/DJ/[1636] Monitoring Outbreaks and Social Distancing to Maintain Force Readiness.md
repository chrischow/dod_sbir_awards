Monitoring Outbreaks and Social Distancing to Maintain Force Readiness
======================================================================

# Abstract


BlackSky proposes an R&D effort to apply BlackSky’s innovative, AI-driven predictive analytics technology to provide deeper insight into the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts on defense readiness. In particular, BlackSky will provide key intelligence into the following areas. -      The spread of COVID-19 in localities housing USAF personnel, including the application and effectiveness of social distancing. -      The status of critical nodes of the supply chain and the impact of COVID-19 on the defense industrial base and force readiness during the expansion and recovery stages of the Pandemic. By combining global geospatial data sources with satellite remote sensing data, Spectra AI will provide a near-real time look at the growing pandemic. BlackSky will deliver to the USAF a predictive data analytics capability. This will combine lessons learned from this research into a set of tools and data feeds that can be used to provide predictive intelligence and insights into the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on global force readiness.
