Mission Planning Software- Next Generation
==========================================

# Abstract


To address need to develop an advanced software refactoring algorithm, using artificial intelligence (AI) technology or other similar innovative development approach, to facilitatetransition of legacy mission planning software to a capabilities based, open architecture, next generation mission planning software suite supporting both manned an unmanned operations. PMATs proposed solution, Mission Planning Software - Next Generation, will evaluate and integrate multiple technologies to facilitate machine learning and AI technologies through combining PMAT's Intelligence Collaboration and Analytics Platform (ICAP) open architectural framework and data fusion capabilities with SparkCognition's machine learning and advanced algorithms solution SparkPredict(TM) solution. Research of the Mission Planning System - Next Generation will consist of four technical objectives needed to repurpose and integrate ICAP and SparkPredict(TM) to integrate real-time machine learning and AI aided advanced refactoring to support time dominate operational mission planning. These objectives include the development of a conceptual planning model, conceptual workflows, refactoring technology to support backwards planning, and prototype development. Each technical objective support the identification of associated operational risk and mitigation plans to support include feasibility prototypes and experiments.
