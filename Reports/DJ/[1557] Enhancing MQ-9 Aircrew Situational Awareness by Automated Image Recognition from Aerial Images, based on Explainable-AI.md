Enhancing MQ-9 Aircrew Situational Awareness by Automated Image Recognition from Aerial Images, based on Explainable-AI
=======================================================================================================================

# Abstract


ZACâ€™s detailed image recognition technology based on our Explainable-AI (artificial intelligence) is capable of obtaining various fine details from images taken at various camera angles, including aerial images from MQ-9 (as well as satellite or other aerial images), under varying conditions and occlusion, to accurately locate and identify objects of interest and enhance aircrew situational awareness and performance. Our technology has surpassed the best alternatives in the industry (ResNet).
