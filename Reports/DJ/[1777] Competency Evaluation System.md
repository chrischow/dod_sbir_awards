Competency Evaluation System
============================

# Abstract


TED text LLC and our teaming partner and research institute Old Dominion University will conduct a feasibility study and development of Short Message Service (SMS) capabilities designed to gather and evaluate workforce competency/proficiency data. In the past, competency model data collection has been limited to those you can personally interview or observe on the job or was built around past experiences, both of which have significant drawbacks in the quality and validity of the designed model. Team TED is proposing an SMS capability that turns every cell phone or SMS capable device into a competency data gathering or competency evaluation tool.  As technology advances our inability to rapidly gather and assess competency data has a vastly negative impact on how our workforce performs. TED text uses open SMS capability where there are no APPs or unique software downloads required.  Simply text a unique identifier or QR code to start collecting or evaluating competency data.  Using TED Competency Evaluation System (CES) is a force multiplier in creating a bonafide and competent workforce in any industry. TED CES data shall be gathered and stored in an agnostic environment where it is easily ingested into Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Talent Management.
