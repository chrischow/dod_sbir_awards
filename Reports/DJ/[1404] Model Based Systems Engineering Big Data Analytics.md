Model Based Systems Engineering Big Data Analytics
==================================================

# Abstract


WW Technology Groups (WWTG) proposed effort provides a scalable and powerful framework and foundation for Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) of Big Data (BD) with a software toolchain.The approach uses an established front end to perform the connection to data storage and flow of information that can consume a wide variety of data types and formats found in engineering documents.A series of BD analytic methods are used to reduce the information into a meta database.Advanced techniques are introduced to enhance the structure and mapping of this metadata for use in unified MBSE system model.WWTG existing tools are then used to manage and display the unified model and perform Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The methods will enable development of knowledge structures and mappings to obtain the highest quality information for seeding designs, development of capabilities, and efficient system integration with substantial prior knowledge from the vast collection of technical development documentation provided to the Government through years of system acquisition and sustainment.The capabilities to be developed are an extension and integration of existing tools that will readily integrate with existing DoD processes and capabilities.
