SCALE: Smart, Containerized and Accessible Large-scale Environment
==================================================================

# Abstract


USAF requires access to the latest Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and Machine Learning (ML) tools as well as associated computational resources for quickly and efficiently carrying out their mission in the areas of intelligence analysis, predictive modeling and other data analytics operations.  Through the SCALE project we will leverage InfiniteTactics existing products and expertise to provide fast and easy access to A.I., ML, and data analytics tools along with intelligently orchestrating their “scalable” execution for the USAF data analytics community.   More specifically under the Phase 2 effort, SCALE will (1) facilitate seamless processing across DoD HPCs and multiple cloud vendors for USAF end users, (2) intelligently schedule analytic workflows on these resources based on cost, timing, and scaling requirements and (3) provide novel mechanisms for quickly integrating, sharing and leveraging new emerging A.I. tools on “scalable” computational resources.
