Low SWaP Ultrawideband RF Seeker
================================

# Abstract


ASI will leverage its TRL/MRL-7 Ultrawideband (UWB) Direction Finding (DF) sensor technology to enable small form factor UWB DF seeker capability on individual munitions to defeat beyond line-of-sight targets. As the US military pivots to address near-peer threats and denied airspace mission scenarios, there is a critical requirement for advances in long range munitions capable of precision strike against specific targets of interest. Mobile, time sensitive targets, like adversary air defense radar, require autonomous, long-standoff, precision strike munitions using target-specific search, track, and seeker technologies. The proposed sensor delivers Affordable Mass by utilizing miniature, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), semiconductor components and a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA). It increases Reach using an integrated Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) subsystem to autonomously detect, classify and localize threat radar from beyond the radar’s horizon, including counter-stealth, search and engagement air defense radar. Collaboration is through standard MOSA interfaces to communicate threat emitter type and location parameters in realtime in a fluid battlespace. The entire sensor (aperture and electronics) fits in a cylinder that is 5” in diameter and 5” in length.
