# Abstract


Data analytics is the science of extracting trends and actionable information from large data sets. Agencies and Companies use this information to improve their management and operations. Graph Database, also referred to as Knowledge Graph, is one of the leading technologies for analyzing Big Data. Unlike other Database Management Systems (DBMS), relationships take first priority in Knowledge Graphs. The relationships allow data to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Knowledge Graphs excel at managing highly-connected data and complex queries. Benefits include the ability to scale more naturally to large data sets, flexibility for evolving data structures and faster processing speed for related data sets. The global Graph Database market is expected to grow from $821.8 Million in 2018 to $2,409.1 Million by 2023, at a CAGR of 24.0% during the forecast period.1 The United States Air Force (USAF) mastery of "big data" is imperative for special operations activities that rely on real time intelligence and very early indicators. USAF retrieves significant amounts of unclassified data during reconnaissance missions which is sent to command centers for exfiltration. Knowledge Graph technology enables real time extraction and exploitation of this data. (1) MarketsandMarkets 2017.
