MAKANA: Machine Learning Platform for Automated AI
==================================================

# Abstract


We propose to solve the challenges facing USAF ISR and ACC surrounding the complexity of Multi-INT data fusion and long go-to-market durations for AI solutions by using the Mobius Logic open architecture Machine Learning platform called MAKANA. By addressing these challenges, the USAF ISR would be able to deliver on the USAF Deputy Chief of Staffâ€™s call for the â€œSense, Identify, Attribute, Shareâ€� (SIAS) initiative. Our Phase I Technical Objectives are to (1) understand the technical challenges surrounding Tasking and Data Sourcing within ISR and ACC, (2) architect a MAKANA-integrated solution that leverages functionality offered by MAKANA to deliver on the SIAS program objectives, and (3) demonstrate the technical feasibility and scalability of the architected solution on a Mobius Logic-hosted MAKANA implementation for USAF leadership.
