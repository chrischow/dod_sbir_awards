Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need

# Abstract


Enview's 3D Geospatial Analytics platform will be implemented for AFSOC end-users to improve mission planning analytics in the PACOM AOR. The platform transforms nation-scale 3D geospatial remote sensing data into insights and actions through the application of 3D computer vision, deep learning, and high performance computing. By fusing aerial collections of LiDAR and imagery, Enview will rapidly transform raw data into clear mission-planning interfaces within hours of collection. These interfaces will include considerations for routes, potential threats, nearby infrastructure, and topography and hydrography that may impact the mission. Enview will provide AFSOC with greater awareness pre-mission, with faster results from time of collection, and the power of machine learning to detect patterns and anomalies invisible to the human.
