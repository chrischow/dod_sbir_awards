Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


New developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and data fusion technologies may be leveraged to provide innovative human-machine interfaces for manned and unmanned systems for present and future United States Air Force (USAF) requirements. Applied Minds, LLC (AMI) uses the underlying concept: Flexibility is the new strength, agility the new imperative, and innovation the only way to win. There is an opportunity to leverage modern concepts of software-definability from the smartphone industry and the billions of dollars of funding in advanced autonomy in the IT and automotive sectors to dramatically increase the performance of military vehicles. AMI will utilize these advancements heavily in its approach, in addition to solutions in its own technology portfolio.
