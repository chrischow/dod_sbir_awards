Open Call For Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions With A Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The combination of sensor proliferation, increasing interest in autonomous systems, and advancements in artificial intelligence are making perception dataimages, video, LIDAR, etc.every more valuable to the Air Force.However, this class of data is inherently unstructured and result in massive file sizes, which makes existing off-the-shelf data recovery and warehousing solutions insufficient.Raven[Ops] explored the need for a Perception Data Management System (PDMS) to handle this data within the Air Force. The initial focus was on robotics and autonomous systems, but Raven[Ops] found a larger need to aggregate perception-class data in a variety of other contexts from the intelligence community to Air Operations Centers.For the Air Force to remain competitive in artificial intelligence and to maximize the use of data from different sources, it will need the ability to recover, organize, search, and access perception class data provided by a PDMS.
