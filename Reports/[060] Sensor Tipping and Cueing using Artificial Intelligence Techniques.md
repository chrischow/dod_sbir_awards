Sensor Tipping and Cueing using Artificial Intelligence Techniques
==================================================================

# Abstract


The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve OPIR (and other initiating event) follow-on ISR tipping and cueing and satellite bus telemetry data analysis; dramatically shorten the associated response time to new OPIR (and other) events; and improve ISR collection quality, resulting in: improved analyst performance; better-quality schedules; and higher, and better utilization of sensors.  To realize this goal will require development of graphical BTNs to represent the reasoning processes appropriate to different applications (satellite and/or UAV ISR tipping/cueing, satellite bus telemetry data analysis, etc.) and situations along with user-editing features, CBR structure within which to embed the BTNs, and intelligent scheduling capability to optimize the ISR tasking.  The next logical step, as addressed by this proposal, is to develop the full-scale PROACT and integrate it with required existing systems (e.g., EGS, GeoDBs, etc.) for the different applications. We will investigate the ISR tipping/cueing and satellite data bus telemetry problems in more depth.  These investigations will require access to classified information to make sure the full complexity of the problems and all of the required and desired constraints and capabilities are handled.  Fortunately, Stottler Henke has a TOP SECRET facility clearance.
