Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) For Real-Time Pilot Aid Applications
==================================================================

# Abstract


REAL-TIME EXECUTION OF AI ALGORITHMS IS NOT POSSIBLE ON CONVENTIONAL AI COMPUTERS. UNDER AN EARLIER CONTRACT W. W. GAERTNER RESEARCH, INC. HAS DEVELOPED THE (AI)2 - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INSTINCT - ARCHITECTURE WHICH COMBINES TRADITIONAL AI PROCEDURES WITH A VERY FAST AND SOPHISTICATED DATABASE LOOKUP CAPABILITY IN SPECIAL HARDWARE, TO ACHIEVE THE MUCH SHORTER RESPONSE TIME NEEDED FOR &quot;REAL TIME.&quot; IT IS PROPOSED TO ADAPT THIS ARCHITECTURE TO THE PILOT AID APPLICATION AND TO INJECT THE HEAVY USE OF STATISTICAL CONCEPTS (INITIALLY BAYESIAN DECISION ANALYSIS) TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF INCOMPLETE AND CONTRADICTORY DATA. A DEMONSTRATION ORIENTED TOWARD SIGINT ANALYSIS IS RECOMMENDED UNLESS AFWAL SUGGESTS ANOTHER APPLICATION.
