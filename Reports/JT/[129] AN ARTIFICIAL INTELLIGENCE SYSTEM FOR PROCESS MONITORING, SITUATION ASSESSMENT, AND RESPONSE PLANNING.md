AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR PROCESS MONITORING, SITUATION ASSESSMENT, AND RESPONSE PLANNING.
======================================================================================================

# Abstract


THE INNOVATION BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS A NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS CALLED EAGOL. UNLIKE TYPICAL AI SHELLS, THIS SYSTEM INCORPORATES A STRONG REASONING MODEL DERIVED FROM DETAILED COGNITIVE STUDIES OF DECISION MAKING IN A VARIETY OF ARENAS, INCLUDINGINTERNAL MEDICINE DIAGNOSIS, OPERATIONS OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS. PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE INCLUDE CAPABILITIES FOR SITUATION ASSESSMENT, GENERATION AND TRACKING OF EXPECTATIONS BASED EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE (CAST IN THE FORM OF SCENARIOS) AS WELL AS FIRST-PRINCIPLES CAUSE AND EFFECT REASONING. APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE EAGOL FRAMEWORK CAN INCORPORATE STRATEGIES FOR RESPONSE PLANNING AND CLOSED-LOOPDISTURBANCE MANAGEMENT. THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IN THIS INVESTIGATION WILL BE TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE INNOVATION REPRESENTED BY EAGOL CAN BE EMPLOYED USEFULLY IN APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST TO NASA.
