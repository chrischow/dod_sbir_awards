A Networked Flight Dynamics Platform for Collaborative Design and Optimization
==============================================================================

# Abstract


Nabla Zero Labs will investigate the feasibility and technical merit of the Astrodynamics Cloud: A technology enabling the collaborative design, analysis, and optimization of spacecraft trajectories. We aim to support autonomous, integrated, and inter-operable modeling capabilities throughout NASA#39;s mission portfolio, as well as the rapidly-growing small-satellite industry.The technology consolidatesnbsp;both new and existing software, algorithms, and data structures into an on-line, high-performance service. It is based on four core components:1. Thenbsp;Trajectory Graph Data Structure, used for management, traversal, and persistent storage of available transfers.2. Thenbsp;Search Strategy Interface, used for interaction between the graph and existing or new software and algorithms for rapid exploration of transfer options near and around planets, satellites, and small bodies.3. Thenbsp;Trajectory Optimization Interface, used for interaction between the approximate rapid-search solutions and algorithms for high-fidelity trajectory optimization in multi-body environments.4. Thenbsp;Distributed Analytics Engine, used for decentralized collaboration, analytical support, and orchestration of massively-parallel, high-performance workloads, such as situational awareness, machine learning,nbsp;and Monte Carlo analysis.We aim for our technology to continue pushing the current generational leap from sequential computing to concurrent and parallel. In addition, we propose a novel paradigm shift: from an outdated single-user and batch-oriented workflow, to a truly collaborativenbsp;multi-user and incremental view.
