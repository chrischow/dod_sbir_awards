DAAS: Data Analytics for Assurance of Safety
============================================

# Abstract


One of the challenges faced by the National Airspace (NAS) stakeholders in general and the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) i.e., Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in particular is the effective maintenance of safety in presence increasing demand by manned traffic and with introduction of Unmanned Air System (UAS) in the near future. Since there is going to be more traffic within in the same airspace volume some of the current event based, human centric safety mechanisms that are going to be overwhelmed. DAAS architecture addresses the overall requirement for ensuring safe operations in the NAS while embracing its complexity and leveraging the advancements in machine learning through one simple architecture. The single architecture can spawn tools focused at ensuring safety different areas of operation while being able to share information among them. The tools developed using DAAS will provide invaluable support to NASA and industry researchers in identifying, diagnosing and discovering the impacts of NextGen technologies on NAS safety and efficiency.
