Smart Sensor Nodes- Title: Self-Federating Edge Nodes To Autonomously Manage Building Infrastructure
====================================================================================================

# Abstract


This SBIR project proposes an innovative fully-autonomous Smart Cyber Physical System (SCPS) for control and management of buildings, facilities and process control- The proposed technology is comprised of self-federating A-I--driven edge computing nodes that aggregate local sensors, provide coordinated physics-based control decisions, and generate automatic semantic analytics from the big data generated from the system- Today’s buildings are complex stationary robots with large state spaces that exceed those of autonomous vehicles- Despite this complexity, the market approach to building management and process control hasn’t changed in decades: it continues to be an amalgam of independently controlled and unaware sub- systems, managed by simplistic state machines and model-free PID algorithms- The SCPS approach enables fully autonomous control of buildings, the keystone technology for improving building and process control efficiency- The proposed project addresses universal sensor semantics, which together with previously demonstrated advances in state space management using A-I- and predictive control using machine learning, will enable the demonstration of end-to-end guided installation and process control ontology- The proposed technology architecture is designed with the market in mind- Not only does the architecture enable singular control, but it also simplifies and democratizes the installation of building automation-
