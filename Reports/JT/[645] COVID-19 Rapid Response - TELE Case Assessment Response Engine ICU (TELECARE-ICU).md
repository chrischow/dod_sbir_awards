================================================================================

# Abstract


The disaster that is the COVID 19 pandemic will leave large numbers of chronically ill patientsrequiring treatment for lung scarring neurological conditions mental health etc. for many yearsto come. This will continue to place an enormous burden on our already overly stressed healthcare resources and personnel This is especially true for rural hospitals and clinics which havelimited resources and expertise to deal with complex cases and critical care patients.There wasalready a critical shortage of ICU beds and healthcare specialist.The COVID-19 pandemic hasexasperated this problem.SolutionProposal Magic Medical Solutions (proposes the TELE Case Assessment Response Engine ICU(TELECAREICU) which is an intelligent mobile platform to provide comprehensive andautomated ICU patient monitoring and assessment. It is a machine learning algorithm that takesinputs from standard monitoring devices and information from the patient's EHR physicalfindings and ancillary monitoring systems to provide automated assessments of their condition.Monitoring is continuous and the TELECARE ICU dynamically updates the patient's status on adashboard in real time to alert local healthcare workers and remote telemedicine consultants ofchanges in their condition. The solution also integrates with existing telehealth capabilities sothat specialist can be teleconferenced in as needed.ObjectiveThe overall objective of this effort is to determine the feasibility of developing a mobile ICU forrural hospitals that can automatically monitor and manage COVID-19 patients along with othercritical care patients.BenefitsThis effort will decrease the demand on existing hospital and healthcare services reduce the costof care measure treatment adherence identify disease worsening improve accessibility toservices and to extend the reach of services to remote locations. TELECARE ICU will alsohelping create local and remote medical jobs keep rural healthcare facilities operational allow aprecision medicine approach to complex medical management and as a byproduct keeppatients in their local hospitals.Market OpportunityOver the last decade emergency department (EDs) visits increased 26%. Meanwhile the numberof EDs declined 9% and hospitals closed 198000 beds. The math is easy and very concerning.ED crowding was inevitable and has become highlighted with the COVID-19.Given thesefactors there is an inherent need for intelligent monitoring diagnostics and intervention toolsfor the commercial market. This is true for pre-hospital transport ED ICUand chronic care inrural hospitals.
