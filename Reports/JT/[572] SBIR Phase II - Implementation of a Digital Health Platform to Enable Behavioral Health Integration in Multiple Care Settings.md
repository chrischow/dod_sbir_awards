SBIR Phase II: Implementation of a Digital Health Platform to Enable Behavioral Health Integration in Multiple Care Settings
============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to enable behavioral health access and engagement across the continuum of care by improving outcomes, overall wellness, and cost of care by combining integrated care, evidence-based tools, and data science. Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience mental illness in a given year, which costs an estimated $752 billion in healthcare expenditures annually. The proposed work will use artificial intelligence and data science capabilities to create personalized patient experiences outside of clinical settings to improve health outcomes, care team efficiency, and resource utilization. This SBIR Phase II project will use artificial intelligence and data science capabilities to create personalized patient experiences outside of clinical settings. This project will: 1) advance a system with EHR interoperability managing a bi-directional flow of discrete data; 2) automate components of the platformâ€™s comprehensive content and assignment library; and 3) use artificial intelligence, specifically real-time natural language processing, to identify and support patients that are potentially in crisis. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
