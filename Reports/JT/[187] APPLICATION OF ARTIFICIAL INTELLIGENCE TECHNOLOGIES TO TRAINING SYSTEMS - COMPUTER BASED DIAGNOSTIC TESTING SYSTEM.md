APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES TO TRAINING SYSTEMS: COMPUTER BASED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SYSTEM
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


USING AN EXISTING INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM (ITS), PROJECT MEMBERS WILL CREATE THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR A STUDENT MODEL THAT CAN BE USED TO DESIGN AN ADAPTIVE TESTING SYSTEM. THIS TESTING SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR DIAGNOSE STUDENT ERRORS BY ANALYZING THE STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE USING SEVERAL DIFFERENT FACTORS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING A TASK GENERATION SUBSYSTEM THAT CAN GENERATE PROBLEMS TO BE USED TO TEST STUDENTS OR DEMONSTRATE/EXEMPLIFY PORTIONS OF THE CURRICULUM. THE TASK GENERATOR WOULD INTERFACE WITH THE ITS' DOMAIN EXPERT TO "TEST" THE PROBLEM AGAINST THE EXPERT CAPABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM'S SUITABILITY FOR STUDENTS. PERFORMANCE OF THIS PROJECT WILL REQUIRE A REVIEW OF THE PSYCHOMETRIC ISSUES RELATED TO DIAGNOSTIC TESTING TO ENSURE THE INCLUSION OF IMPORTANT TESTING FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES.
