Online Monitoring System to Support Autonomous Remote Microreactor Operations
=============================================================================

# Abstract


Microreactors are factory-fabricated and transportable reactors that can be used for electricity production and thermal energy generation in remote off-grid locations. They are designed to be self- regulating autonomous systems that do not require a large number of on-site staff. To realize the full benefits of autonomous operation, microreactors need online monitoring systems that provide continuous performance verification of critical components at a level of automation that is not available today in the nuclear industry. In addition, microreactor process conditions are harsher relative to existing light water reactors, and existing nuclear sensors may not be capable of withstanding the long-term effects of these stressors in a microreactor. To avoid frequent sensor replacement as a result of calibration drift or premature degradation, durable alternative sensor technologies must be identified and evaluated for microreactor applications. To facilitate the safe and efficient deployment of microreactors in remote off-grid locations, a research and development effort is proposed involving the testing of sensors and embedded instruments that could be installed within microreactors and used in conjunction with an online monitoring system that verifies the health of critical components. In support of this system, artificial intelligence techniques will be identified and developed specifically for microreactor applications. This work will result in hardware and software to support remote autonomous microreactor operations. The research and development effort proposed herein will employ a hands-on approach to develop an online monitoring system that can be used to support autonomous remote operation of microreactors. During this project, process sensors and embedded instruments that could be deployed in microreactors will be identified, obtained, and tested to determine their capabilities for providing the measurements needed to effectively monitor and control microreactors. Online monitoring technologies for in-situ health monitoring of sensors and processes in microreactors will be identified, developed, and demonstrated in a laboratory environment using real-time measurements and existing nuclear plant data sets. The results from testing and demonstrations will be used to develop a conceptual design of an online monitoring system for microreactors to be built in Phase II. In the short-term, the commercialization of the project will focus on developing a portable and configurable online monitoring system to be used at microreactor test facilities to validate modelsand to support future licensing applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the long-term, this online monitoring system will be incorporated into the actual control system of a microreactor to support remote and autonomous operation in off-grid applications. Technologies developed in this project will also benefit advanced reactors and other reactor types.
