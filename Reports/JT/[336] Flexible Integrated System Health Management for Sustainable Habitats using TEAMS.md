Flexible Integrated System Health Management for Sustainable Habitats using TEAMS
=================================================================================

# Abstract


QSI proposes to field a "Flexible" ISHM Solution for Sustainable Habitats utilizing the TEAMS Toolset and concomitant model-based and data-driven diagnostic/prognostic reasoning technologies to enable the habitat crew to obtain crucial alerts that affect the operation of critical habitat subsystems, as well as provide decision support in the selection of appropriate corrective actions. The solution will utilize habitat's real-time system health assessment, anomaly and failure detection, machine learning and active learning techniques to preserve the operational integrity of the habitat system. The proposed effort will result in a novel capability, where the habitat crew will be given clear and concise decision support to improve situational awareness and perform proactive corrective actions. Automated health assessment, crew alerts and future degradation estimates will be generated to facilitate corrective actions in the face of off-nominal and failure conditions. Additionallly, mechanisms to incorporate undiscovered anomalies into the machine learning algorithms will be pursued. The ISHM solution would reduce the cognitive load on the crew given the abundance of information that has to be reasoned upon in a timely fashion. They will be critical for improving mission and system safety. These technologies would reduce the cost and risk of habitat operations, across all its phases: development, flight unit production, launch, and operations.
