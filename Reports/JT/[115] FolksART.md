FolksART
========

# Abstract


Historically speaking, subjectivity was mostly considered as problematic and undesirable. Recently, the availability of the inherently subjective folksonomies has made it readily apparent that inherent subjectivity is highly desirable and that it can be accounted for and utilized by superimposing multiple structures onto data without requiring changes to the underlying data, thus addressing users’ desires to organize data according to their own preferences. 21st Century systems, Incorporated is pleased to propose to research and develop our FolksART concept. This concept automates selected aspects of folksonomy-based, domain-independent contextual reasoning designed to reflect users’ subjective preferences. It involves a rigorous formal notion of context and application and further development of two types of emerging Artificial Intelligence technologies: (1) Hybrid natural language processing, and (2) Natural language-based knowledge representation and reasoning. The project accounts for many types of high-level contextual reasoning, including contextual taxonomic inference and contextual classification. The approach is tested on rich user-tagged image and textual data in many different domains.
