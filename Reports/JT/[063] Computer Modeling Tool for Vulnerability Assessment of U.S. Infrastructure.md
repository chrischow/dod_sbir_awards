Computer Modeling Tool for Vulnerability Assessment of U.S. Infrastructure
==========================================================================

# Abstract


The Vulnerability Assessment Tool will be a valuable asset for focusing on areas of terrorist concern, whether caused by domestic or foreign terrorist organizations. By doing so, limited resources can be utilized with maximum efficiency, whether they be of human, physical, or electronic nature. Given indications and warnings, the tool could accurately assess the potential actions for terrorist groups by either tactic preference (e.g., suicide bombings) or target preference (e.g., airports). Established research in spatio-temporal forecasting and geographic profiling was selected as the approach for Spatial Data Analytics Corporation (SPADAC) to build on to address this challenge. The output of the methodology results in a probability-based assessment that decision-makers can utilize to gauge the relative probability of potential site selections Â¿ in effect ranking likely hot spots of potential activity across any local, state, or national landscape. The commercial applications envisioned include site selection and generic area reduction studies, such as locating a new storefront for a chain.
