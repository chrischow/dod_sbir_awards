Handheld Advanced Detection/Imaging TechNlogy System
====================================================

# Abstract


Currently fielded aviation passenger screening systems are large, fixed systems capable of detecting concealed objects on a person. While this approach is useful for standard passenger screening, there are additional requirements for a handheld system to enable concepts of operations that the fixed systems canNt accommodate.Previous systems have tended to be passive systems that lack the resolution to detect more complex threats at a reasonable price point. However, recent developments in low cost COTS components for 5G wireless networks and associated handheld electronics may allow for solutions that meet performance, size, weight, power, and cost requirements.We plan to use readily available commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) IEEE 60GHz 802.11ad V-band mmW WiFi radios for active illumination, and Nn-contact scanning as part of a small, low-cost (less than $5,000), handheld scanner.This techNlogy will leverage machine learning-based (ML) detection and threat classification algorithms to provide enhanced security and safety while protecting the privacy of the public.
