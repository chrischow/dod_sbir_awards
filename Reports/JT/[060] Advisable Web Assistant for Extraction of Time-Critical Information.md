Advisable Web Assistant for Extraction of Time-Critical Information
===================================================================

# Abstract


We will develop an advisable, self-learning “assistant” capable of monitoring, extracting and assessing data from multiple heterogeneous sources.  The system, called InTIME (Intelligent Trainable Information Monitoring and Extraction system) extends our existing commercial technology for gathering and harvesting remote data, from both Web sites and databases.  Specifically, InTIME is concerned with the continual analysis and monitoring of that data, so that end-users do not have to constantly monitor feeds manually nor be responsible for spotting every possible important change to data.  The system enables users to manage time-critical information automatically, so that important updates are not lost in the sea of data that is continuously generated by multiple dynamic sources.   InTIME uses a machine learning approach so that a user can train the system to learn what information is valuable, why it is valuable, and how and when to notify the user when new information is available.
