High-Resolution Temperature Mapping in a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope
==================================================================================

# Abstract


Sivananthan Laboratories proposes to develop an approach for measuring the temperature of materials with high spatial resolution and temperature accuracy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The PIs will determine the bulk plasmon resonance using electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which has been demonstrated by the PIs to allow for a spatial resolution of better than 2 nm (when combined with high-resolution imaging) and temperature precision of
