Rapid, Portable, Surface Texture Based Component Classifier (RAPSTEC) System
============================================================================

# Abstract


In order to meet the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) need to support the ongoing Department of Defense (DOD) challenge to ensure the authenticity and security of microelectronics parts within its supply chain, ChromoLogic LLC (CLL) proposes to develop RAPSTEC. RAPSTEC is based on a machine vision system designed to capture the surface features of a microelectronic component and use machine learning algorithms to determine if the component is suspect or not. The technology is based on our proven products currently being used within the DOD supply chain to protect it from counterfeit components. During Phase I, we will leverage our current relationships and customers in the DOD microelectronics supply chain and, using new and installed hardware collect additional data on microelectronic components. Using this data and our already vast data sets, we will develop machine learning based algorithms to determine if a component is counterfeit or not within 20 seconds (TRL 4). During Phase II, we will work with DMEA to test and validate the system and deploy pilot units within the DOD supply chain (TRL 7).
