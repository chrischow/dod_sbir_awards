Vulnerability Assessment Tool For Homeland Security
===================================================

# Abstract


Spatial Data Analytic Corporation`s (SPADAC) Vulnerability Assessment Tool For Homeland Security will be built on top of a Geospatial Information System (GIS) to provide a digital map that indicates areas of high concern. Spatial Feature Temporal Analysis will be used to allow for the capture and reuse of targeting signatures for any given group. The system will be built so that a signature can be generated for any set of spatial data, thereby offering commercial oppurtunities in other sectors. In addition to preparing a system conceptual design, SPADAC will derive initial signatures for two relevant terrorist groups. It will then be shown how these signatures can be applied to new areas of interest where historical events have not yet occurred.
