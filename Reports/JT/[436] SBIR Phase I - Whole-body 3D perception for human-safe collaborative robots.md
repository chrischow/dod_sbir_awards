SBIR Phase I: Whole-body 3D perception for human-safe collaborative robots
==========================================================================

# Abstract


The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable a new generation of collaborative robots that are capable and safe. Collaborative robotics is poised to revolutionize manufacturing where they will enable better utilization of factory space and machines, reduce energy cost, and mitigate labor shortages. Safe operation is a critical factor for successful operation of collaborative robotics, especially if they are mobile. The proposed project will demonstrate that tactile sensing skins can make robots safer, more collaborative, and manufactured at reasonable cost. The proposed task will also contribute to workforce development and enhance scientific understanding in the critical fields of robotics, soft robotics, and artificial intelligence, as well as providing opportunities for local students. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate a novel type of tactile sensing skin to improve robot safety and its ability to interact with human users. Unlike previous work, the proposed skin can detect obstacles from a distance of up to 20cm, as well as measuring contact and force. Also, the ability to detect user gestures such as tapping, rubbing or poking, opens new avenues for human-robot interaction and will enable the study of truly collaborative robots. The proposed research and development project will overcome the following key challenges that stand in the way of commercializing the technology: scaling from single patches to full-body sensing skins, fusing proximity data collected from the skin with those provided by conventional 3D sensors, and demonstrating its benefits in a series of real-world use cases. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
