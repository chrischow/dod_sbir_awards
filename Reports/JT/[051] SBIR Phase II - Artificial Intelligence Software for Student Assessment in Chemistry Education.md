SBIR Phase II: Artificial Intelligence Software for Student Assessment in Chemistry Education
=============================================================================================

# Abstract


This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds Phase I work on development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry education software.  Despite clearly articulated teacher and student demand for improvement, this area has been repeatedly identified as that where existing offerings are weakest.  Quantum Simulations proposes a new and different approach, adapting and incorporating new concepts from artificial intelligence (AI).  More than just assigning a grade, meaningful opportunities will be created for students to learn directly from the assessment itself.  The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need--such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups-- by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum  Simulations has partnered with members of the Department of Education's STAR Schools program to further these goals.

Quantum Simulations' customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies.  A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into a long-term contract and has partnered with Quantum Simulations to commercialize this Phase II technology, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base.
