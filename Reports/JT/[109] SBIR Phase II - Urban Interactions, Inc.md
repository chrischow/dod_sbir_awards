=======================================

# Abstract


This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to improve the quality of on-demand job matching by applying data mining and machine learning techniques to natural language descriptions of job requests, worker reviews, and transaction history. The project will enable lasting job matches by predicting the needs, preferences and constraints of workers and human resource managers. Currently available methods of job matching rely primarily on keyword search, corporate personality assessment tests, or fixed ontologies. Such systems lack comprehensive learning and therefore have difficulty matching workers with jobs. This project approaches job matching with a bias-free learning model that learns from hiring successes, trains on real-world data, and adapts to new job verticals.
The broader/commercial impact of the project is a matching technology that optimizes workers' and employers' strengths, discovering matching opportunities overlooked by traditional search technologies. Online reputation-building through performance reviews can improve workers' ability to market themselves. The global matching technology permits nearly every skill to become marketable by matching workers with all features from every available job request. Natural language processing techniques, developed in the course of this project, have the potential to broaden the appeal of cell phone text-messaging as a comprehensive job-searching tool. Furthermore, the contextual approach to learning about workers and employers enables trends to be identified among  users, and has far-reaching commercial implications in fields as diverse as medical research and e-commerce.
