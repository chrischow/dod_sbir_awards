Compact High Power 3D LiDAR System for (UAS) Unmanned Aircraft Systems
======================================================================

# Abstract


Eotron has introduced a high performance 3D Time-of-Flight Laser illumination source based on its patented silicon packaging technology originally developed to improve power and brightness in high-power diode laser modules.  Using proprietary design, fabrication and thermal management techniques, Eotron has developed a compact Laser illumination source that achieves a high pulse modulation rate and peak power output with fast rise times.  This technology allows for real time 3D imaging and ranging using higher peak power and pulse rate to provide both long distance and high resolution imaging. Eotrons 3D Time-Of-Flight (TOF) technology will add new dimensions and capabilities to a seemingly endless number of applications. Whether it is for collision avoidance systems for manned or unmanned air or ground vehicles, surveillance system?s intruder detection or identification, robotic vision or artificial intelligence, all can benefit from this technology.  Add to this that the technology is Wafer Scale Production ready, lowering the cost of production in volume.
