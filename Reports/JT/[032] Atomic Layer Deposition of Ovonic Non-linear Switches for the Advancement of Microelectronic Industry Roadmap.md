Atomic Layer Deposition of Ovonic Non-linear Switches for the Advancement of Microelectronic Industry Roadmap
=============================================================================================================

# Abstract


Key enabler for ground-breaking technologies such as internet of things (IOT), automated driving system (ADS), and artificial intelligence (AI), is energy efficient high density microelectronic circuitry. Commercial chip makers such as Intel and IBM have championed the advancement of high density integration to realize the improved scalability, reliability, speed and density of integrated circuit (IC) products. While many of the advancements are enabled by the introduction of non-linear ovonic threshold switches (OTS), current OTS designs require synthesis of complex electronic materials that are prone to large leakage, and demand high power for operation. These issues must be effectively addressed before realizing full potential of the technologies of future and at the same time saving substantial energy. The focus of the proposed project is to address the specific issues with current microelectronics technology through the development of innovative electronic materials with unique properties and novel atomic precision manufacturing methodology. The goal of the Phase I research is to demonstrate feasibility of our approach. Specifically we will demonstrate non-linear ovonic threshold switch (OTS) device based on novel chalcogenide material. The OTS of required thickness will be grown one atomic layer at a time using a unique technique commonly used in fab-labs. The device metallization will be performed to conduct evaluations. The characterization will include determination of threshold voltage, switching speed, and endurance, and demonstration of ovonic behavior. To ensure success RMD team is amended by the addition of highly credible collaborator and a consultants, both of whom are actively pursuing microelectronics research over the past several decades. The proposed development is highly relevant to manufacturing of advanced microelectronic devices currently being developed by such chip manufacturers as Intel and IBM. For instance, the proposed OTS can be immediately incorporated into new designs of phase-change memory (PCM) circuits to realize very high density, low power memory devices. The market for microelectronic devices is billions of dollars annualy, substantial fraction of which represents areas where proposed technology can make a transformational impact.
