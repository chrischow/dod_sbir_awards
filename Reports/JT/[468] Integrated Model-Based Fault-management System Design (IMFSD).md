Integrated Model-Based Fault-management System Design (IMFSD)
=============================================================

# Abstract


ASCA is developing an Integrated Model-based Fault-management System Design (IMFSD) workstation for current-generation and future high-autonomy space systems. The resulting product will integrate and document in one framework Fault Management (FM) design processes, models and products. The IMFSD covers FM requirements definition, design specification, analysis, validation-and-verification (Vamp;V), and documentation. This provides the connection of the associated processes and models to the corresponding elements of the host space system model-based design.nbsp;The integration of FM developmentnbsp;life-cycle processes is achieved by means of a ldquo;design development, documentation, and assurance caserdquo; (D3AC) logic structure hosted within the IMFSD software platform, which provides active connectivity among all elements of the FM design, and with the evidences produced to demonstrate compliance with FM design and operations goals, and with the derived requirements.In view of expected spacecraft-autonomy evolutions for which expanded FM operational capability and analytics will be needed, the IMFSD, in addition to established FM models like Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, includes, or links to, logic-dynamic models and AI decision / action selection models ndash; e.g., Dynamic Flowgraph Methodology, Markov Cell-to-Cell Mapping Technique ndash; that can extend FM analysis into the time-dependent-logic domain. Other potentially applicable state-of-the-art models from the field of machine-learning, like Bayesian Belief Networks, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Influence Diagrams, are also evaluated and demonstrated for evolutionary inclusion in the IMFSD.Once demonstrated for NASA applications, the IMFSD will be transferable to the design of FM for the high-autonomy commercial systems that are presently being developed in the aeronautical and road transportation fields. This provides a path for commercialization efforts that will be initiated during Phase II.
