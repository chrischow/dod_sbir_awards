SBIR Phase II: Independent Science Learning through Serious Games with Expert Avatars and Complementary Stories
===============================================================================================================

# Abstract


This SBIR Phase II project will provide an engaging independent-learning platform which weaves science into an exciting story for ages eight to thirteen. The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer students' questions. It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe. It engages students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex. Besides school use, the game's independent learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model for the Company through school and commercial sales. The technology can also support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application for many other educational and training requirements. The innovation is a unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex. The platform combines video games, a complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt) that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions. The artificial intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures, exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority scientists.
