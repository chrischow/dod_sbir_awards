Advisable Web Assistant for Extraction of Time-Critical Information
===================================================================

# Abstract


We will develop an advisable, self-learning "assistant" capable of monitoring, extracting and assessing data from multiple heterogeneous sources.  The system, called InTIME (Intelligent Trainable Information Monitoring and Extraction system) will be built on top of the Fetch Agent Platform, a commercial system for building and executing software agents that extract and integrate data from Web sites.  Through the use of machine learning, users can train the system to extract data from Web sites "by example."  We plan to extend our existing machine learning approach so that a user can train the system to learn what information is valuable, why it is valuable, and how and when to notify the user when new information is available.
