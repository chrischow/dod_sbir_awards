Machine Learning for Earth Science
==================================

# Abstract


Kraenion#39;s is an applied machine learning company developing a Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) software platform named Vision Engine. It provides robust pre-trained visual intelligence solutions and keeps up with the latest in AI research, but can be customized for specific customer needs. It was engineered to produce good neural networks quickly on modest computers. This engineering investment has been worthwhile: we were able to get 100% accuracy on the DeepSat Earth Science dataset in under 1 hour on a laptop. Vision Engine includes an active learning based neural network training technology where the training software is aware of the cost of labeling data. Unlike traditional neural network training that assumes a large labeled dataset, our system carefully picks samples that maximize the learning opportunity and presents it for labeling to a human annotator. This provides much higher return on dollars invested for data annotation in areas like Earth Science where unlabeled data is abundant, but there is a scarcity of labeled data.Web:nbsp;http://kraenion.com
