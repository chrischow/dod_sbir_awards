# Abstract


isk assessment experts on the identification of food safety priorities using the Delphi techniquestated that foodborne viruses were among the top-rated food safety priorities and have become ofgreat concern to the food industry over the past few years. Food safety experts agreed that controlmeasures for viruses throughout the food chain are required. However understanding with regardto the effective controls and how to properly validate performance whether it is the personalhygiene of food handlers the processing of at-risk foods or the interpretation and action requiredon a positive virus test result. Multiple techniques and technologies have been developed for viraldetection and control. In addition there are gaps in understanding and future perspectives on theapplication of viral detection and control strategies for the food industry along with suggestionson how the food industry should implement effective control strategies for viruses in foods. Wewill address the current state of the food supply chain and the greatest impact using science on thepublic health burden risk assessment and management options from harvest to consumption.IoT AI and blockchain play a part as an enabler of digital supply networks and ecosystems thatare connected intelligent collaborative and trusted. Integrated these disruptive technologies addgreat value by achieving a safe farm to table supply chain model. Integration between IoTplatforms and supply chain management systems bring richer more highly granular datasets intothe mix; AI and machine learning enhanced system understanding; anchored to a blockchainnetwork create cross boundary processes to blockchain-based smart contracts and createautonomous decentralized applications. With this all parties in the ecosystem behave as peers(where appropriate) and the blockchain enables them to trust in the data shared with them.Full lifecycle digital twins enable a blockchain to maintain a digital ledger that tracks the productalong with predictive outcomes. IoT AI and blockchain add value to supply chain managementin isolation; in combination they present the opportunity to set a new standard and to deliver asmarter well-defined intelligent autonomous food supply chain operation. Analytics and AIlayered with verifiable data sources extend the 'process zone' to the ecosystem partners as smartcontracts are executed. As supply chains evolve into networks and ecosystems; our expectation isto achieve an increasingly safe food supply chain impacting the health and security of this nation
