Integrated Adaptive Route Capability
====================================

# Abstract


The key innovation with the Integrated Adaptive Route Capability (IARC) system, is a web-based application replacing FAArsquo;s legacy Route Management Tool (RMT) with advanced automation expanding capacity to efficiently automate and manage Pre-validated Route Options - within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) and globally - using autonomous technologies. nbsp;IARC will provide improvements in (1) machine-learning capabilities, (2) real-time information sharing with stakeholders, (3) inclusion of future UAS routing needs, and (4) integration of weather constraint model forecasting on routes. nbsp;These four areas are foundation to a product that needs replace legacy RMT used within FAA and be eventually commercialized globally
