Intelligent, Wireless, Agent-based Health Monitoring Network for PTSD and Alcohol
=================================================================================

# Abstract


Erallo proposes to design a multi-agent, service orientated software and hardware architecture for remote wireless sensor monitoring and data processing. The architecture will combine the best aspects of different architectures, including Wireless Sensor Networks, Mobile Multi Agent strategies, Service Orientated Architectures, Artificial Intelligence and Multi Sensor Data Fusion techniques to accomplish a modular, flexibility and efficient platform that can deploy a wide range of sensor monitoring applications.   In parallel with the architectural design, we will design and specify a prototype application.  This dual approach will promote the solid design of a architecture that assimilates the needs of applications into the core of its framework.  The prototype application will incorporate three sensors that Erallo has worked with previously, including a wireless transdermal alcohol sensor, heart rate monitor and accelerometer. Erallo also proposes to conduct a limited clinical trial at the end of Phase I using the 3 sensor devices to demonstration the feasibility and operations of a wireless sensor network system with automatic daily data transmission. The trial will collect data that can be used in the knowledge base for the PTSD application being designed in Phase I and planned for trial in Phase II.
