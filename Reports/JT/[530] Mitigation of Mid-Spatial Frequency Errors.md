Mitigation of Mid-Spatial Frequency Errors
==========================================

# Abstract


Freeform optics allow decreased size and increased flexibility in optical design. However, mid-spatial Frequency (MSF) errors, a common side effect of freeform optic fabrication, can significantly disrupt UV optic performance. Although many techniques have been studied to mitigate MSF errors, elimination often relies on artisan technique. This proposal outlines a feasibility study for the VR HERMES (VIBE Robotic High End Responsive MSF Elimination System). A SiC with silicon cladding, ornbsp;silicon, freeform optic (diameter =lt; 0.25 m) will be generated and polished through the techniques derived at Optimax via years of SBIR and commercial work. After polishing, MSF errors will be characterized through metrology such as computer generated holograms and deflectometry, and the errors will be mitigated by artisans. The smoothing process will be completed while the artisans guide collaborative robots. With this procedure, data will be collected regarding the artisan#39;s technique (i.e., a quot;Process Mapquot;). Through the use of state-of-the-art metrology, Optimax will attempt to capture artisan techniques via machine learning algorithms, and compare that to mapped MSF error data. Optimax will use an iterative approach to create algorithms that can then predict, given an error map, what techniques an artisan would apply to to optic to correct the MSF errors (i.e.,nbsp;a quot;Predicted Mapquot;). The quot;Predicted Mapquot; will then be compared to the next quot;Process Mapquot; and deficiencies identified and used to refine the algorithm. Future work will address creating tool paths directly from metrology data from the quot;Process Mapquot; algorithms generated in Phase I.nbsp;
