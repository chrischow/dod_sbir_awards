Personalized Driving Data for Insurance Discounts &amp; Public Benefits
=======================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal suggests research on developing the next generation of consumer experience for Usage Based Insurance (UBI) in an increasingly socially connected world while addressing the need to protect privacy. It will enhance Agnik’s current consumer and UBI products through the following innovations:
 Collective Incentives and Game Theory: Explore the problem of risk modeling and underwriting from a social perspective using a game theoretic analytical framework in order to design loyalty programs for drivers.
 Pattern Preserving Encryption: Explore privacy-protecting data analytics algorithms for blending “pattern-preserving cryptography” with data analytics so that driver data can be analyzed without having to access raw privacy-sensitive location or driving data.
 Reducing Cost and Enhancing the UBI Experience: In addition to supporting Agnik’s existing OBD-II dongle-based solutions, Agnik and Harman International will collaborate to integrate the Agnik Onboard software with Harman
Infotainment system built into the head-unit of many vehicles. This will eliminate the additional cost of aftermarket OBDII dongles. The project will also explore integration with Harman’s iOnRoad smartphone App for improving consumer experience and enhanced actuarial calculations.
The proposed research will be performed by Agnik and Harman International. Supporting letters from Liberty Mutual and American Family Insurance Companies are enclosed.
