# Abstract


The biggest problem is there are not many computer companies that are capable of storing large upload digital data- Most servers that are made for the public lack info structure, hardware and software capabilities- The servers are not turnkey ready and the cost for having server available is really expensive- People should be able to have the flexibility and the server power to be capable to do computer modeling- There are many computer server companies who cannot upload large data sets whether it’s for computer agents, computer modeling or computer aided design- The speed of upload servers are a problem because of the size of most data sets- Some programs sizes can be as much as 24 gigabytes of data- To upload one file it will take over 30 minutes to do- Most computer companies will not even upload the file because it’s too big- They also cannot store large data volumes or terabytes worth of data- That’s a problem now a days because many people are using digital data more than ever- Furthermore, there are retrieval issues most of the time programs are downloaded back down on to the computer causing hard drives to be loaded with large digital data- You might not think that it is not a problem but try getting to you large data on a public computer and see if you like your work being downloaded on public property, very slowly? The goal is to have fast servers that are dependable and secure- The program has to collect, manage, and analysis BIG DATA sets- Also, other goals is to have digital uploads be safe from viruses that do not harm any consumers computer or server hardware- Viruses will slow down the velocity of the computer- The program tools will be easy to function- Our program objective is to make innovative programs that consumers can upload computer models and data analytics into individual databases that individuals can control and operate- This approach will concern this 4 key things- The first key is the security to stop viruses for coming onto the system causing havoc to the databases and servers themselves- The second key is the configuration of the servers themselves and how they are configured?The 3rdkey is which programs to use to organize the servers and how many hard drives do we need? Also what tasks do we need done? How do we make the server work together? The 4th key is programing the work tools needed to produce new database sets and graphs- This proposal should answer all your questions about the configuration procedure- The design of the computer data servers will be a major factor on cost-The chief principals of the design all factors in speed and price- Its critical for this program to be cost effective for the consumers to have high speed digital uploads and retrievals-
