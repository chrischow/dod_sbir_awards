# Abstract


THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATING DECISION ANALYSIS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH PLANNING AIDS INTO AN INTEGRATED SET OF AIDS FOR PERFORMING FUNCTIONS IN OCA MISSION PLANNING, FROM THE TARGET NOMINATION LEVEL DOWN THORUGH THE SPECIFIC ROUTE PLANNING LEVEL. PHASE I EFFORT WILL EMPHASIZE TECHNOLOGY ISSUES RATHER THAN ENGINEERING DESIGN AND BUILD ISSUES. THE ANALYSIS WILL USE BOTH A TOP DOWN THEM AND A BOTTOM UP APPROACH. THE REQUIREMENTS AND ARCHITECTURAL ASPECTS WILL BE EXPLORED FROM THE MORE ENCOMPASSING PERSPECTIVE OF THE TOTAL MISSION PLANNING ENVIRONMENT OF AN ATAF. THE RESULTING STRUCTURE WILL PROVIDE SOFT CONSTRAINTS DURING OUR MORE DETAILED EXPERIMENTATION WITH SPECIFIC AIDS. WE WILL EXPERIMENT WITH COMBINING THE EXISTING (RESEARCH) AIDS (TARGET PRIORITIZATION AID (TPA), KNOBS, AND ROUTH PLANNING AID (RPA) THAT HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALLY DEVELOPED FOR DIFFERENCE LEVELS OF THE OCA PLANNING PROCESS. RESEARCH ISSUES WILL INCLUDE PERFORMANCE MEASURES, SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, LEVELS OF DATA\INFORMATION AGGREAGTION (DEGREES OF DETAIL), FEEDBACK, DISTRIBUTED DATA BASES MANAGEMENT, AND MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE.
