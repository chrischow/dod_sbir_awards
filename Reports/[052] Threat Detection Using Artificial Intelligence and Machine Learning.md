Threat Detection Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
===================================================================

# Abstract


In both the commercial and military environments, the data explosion has both facilitated and required the development of automatic exploitation algorithms. In this phase I effort we will apply current state of the art DCNNs to characterize and detect threats at forward operating bases(FOB).Our solution is based on the ImageNet classes, which will be modified and adapted by the analyst via transfer learning to characterize regions of interest within the mosaic of sensor imagery.This information will be presented to the analyst via our NTellus heatmap tool. Labels and interactions specific to FOB activities will be gathered to define a normalcy model.
