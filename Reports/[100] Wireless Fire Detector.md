Wireless Fire Detector
======================

# Abstract


MSI develops and commercializes intelligent instrumentation modules. Our product emphasis is on instruments mounted in aircraft wiring connector. Their purpose is to provide real time situation awareness for component and system health monitoring. This topic fits perfectly with our current projects that are developing “smart” instrument systems for component diagnostics and prognostics, aircraft engine health monitoring, and aircraft health management. We propose a new SBIR research program that will adapt and enhance our electronic and artificial intelligence technologies to develop, design, build, and demonstrate a reliable yet rapid wireless fire detector system compatible with future and legacy aircraft. The wireless modality will send alerts to a receiver in the cockpit. The connector mounted format would wireless communications and provide additional flexibility for crew training and safety by connecting to the aircraft data bus.  The Boeing Phantomworks vehicle health management systems (VHMS) group has agreed to be our mentor our engineers by providing aircraft domain expertise during the contract work effort.
