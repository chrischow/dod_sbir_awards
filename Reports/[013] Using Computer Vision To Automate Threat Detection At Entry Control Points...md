Using Computer Vision To Automate Threat Detection At Entry Control Points
==========================================================================

# Abstract


Soldiers operating the AFs X-ray machines at Entry Control Points (ECPs) are the last line of defense from individuals entering with weapons and threats such as guns, knives or IEDs. However, these AF security personnel are responsible for operating and tracking a number of security systems, which can be distracting from X-ray image interpretation. Scanning image interpretation is a time consuming and specialized skill requiring training processes inconsistent with Security Forces rotation schedule.Finally, assessing X-ray images requires security personnel to be at the systems and close to potential IEDs and attackers, putting soldiers at risk and limiting their mission flexibility. Synapse will augment its existing Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning technology, Syntech ONE (SAFETY Act DT&amp;E certified), which uses computer vision techniques to automatically detect weapons and IEDs.The Synapse technology will be deployable on legacy AF ECP X-ray machines.The automatic detection capabilities will improve detection and allow AF operators to more efficiently and safely manage ECP operations.
