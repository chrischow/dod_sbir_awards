Open Call For Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions
============================================================================

# Abstract


During a mission seconds count. Suboptimal HMI costs time, creates opportunities for warfighter error, and requires undue training. Awayr analyzes interface designs to accurately predict distraction, and the elements responsible. Awayr is presently developed for civilian semi-autonomous automotive interface. This innovative expert system has strong potential in defense-related domains, especially unmanned aerial systems (UASs). The present effort will explore the adaptation of Awayr to face DOD customers. We will consider Awayrs application to human machine interface (HMI), which UAV operators use to command and control unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assets. Awayr can potentially model and improve human-machine teaming a) between artificially intelligent autonomous systems and an individual expert human operator (1-1), b) between an operator and a swarm (1-n), and c) in fully distributed human-machine systems (n-1). We will also consider Awayrs technology for real-time state detection and response systems, toward UAV interface which form responsive real-time teams with human operators, rapidly directing attention to appropriate channels. Both feasibility evaluations will focus on USAF Priorities for the present SBIR, as well as cross-benefit to our commercial product. The goal: a dual-purpose expert system for optimized human-machine teaming, increasing mission success for the warfighter and on-road safety for the civilian population.
