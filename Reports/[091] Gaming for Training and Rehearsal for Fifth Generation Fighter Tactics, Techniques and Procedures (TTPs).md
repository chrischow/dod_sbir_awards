Gaming for Training and Rehearsal for Fifth Generation Fighter Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
========================================================================================================

# Abstract


This project is intended to create a top down, effects based simulation set at the air unit level (from individual aircraft to larger mission packages) in which Fifth Generation Fighter Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) can be evaluated. The model will simulate air operations at the level of air mission packages, with individual aircraft modeled within this context. The intent is to create scenarios which will generate unique TTPs that can then be tested and applied as doctrine. Friendly, enemy and civilian forces will be represented by artificial intelligence (AI) agents. Information will be represented from the point of view of individual pilots, mission commanders, and the big picture of an entire operation. Each agent will be motivated by quantitative and qualitative factors. For aircraft this would include flight handling characteristics, pilot training, and networking systems. The simulation will be able to both train individual pilots in operating via TTPs, and to provide doctrinal personnel with a model through which new TTPs could be developed. There will also be a networking capability to allow for larger scenarios in which numerous utilizers could be trained, and higher echelon TTPs be evaluated and developed.  BENEFIT: A successfully completed project will provide the end user with a fully extensible and scalable training application that will provide an immersive training experience in which Fifth Generation Fighter tactics can be rehearsed and developed. Players will interact with a customized environment that will mimic the real world fighter tactical environment. This can be applied to military, law enforcement, emergency service and air traffic control situations.
