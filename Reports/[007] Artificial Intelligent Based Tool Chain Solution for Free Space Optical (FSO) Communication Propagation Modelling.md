Artificial Intelligent Based Tool Chain Solution for Free Space Optical (FSO) Communication Propagation Modelling
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


To achieve high accuracy, free space optical communication (FSOC) propagation modeling and analysis for various battlespace scenarios, Intelligent Fusion Technology, Inc. (IFT) and its university partner University of North Florida, propose to develop a tool-chain based FSOC coverage analysis and prediction platform by using software-in-the-loop (SITL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) algorithms. A high fidelity physical FSOC propagation model with artificial intelligent based data verification and enhancement is implemented in the central processor of the proposed platform. The physics based model will be developed by identifying and analyzing all possible factors including absorption, scattering, weather conditions, beam divergence, and atmospheric turbulence. An advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is then applied to verify and enhance the accuracy of prediction. Besides the central processor, the proposed platform also consists of a developed front end with real-time human-machine interaction, a designed compendium of all the identified factors that can affect the FSOC propagation, and multiple available databases that are integrated to acquire corresponding datasets. The proposed solution has significant advantages in terms of high-fidelity prediction accuracy, scalability, time efficiency, and low cost.
