PROPOSAL TO BASELINE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ASSISTANCE FOR AIRCREWSFOR THE YEAR 2000
=====================================================================================

# Abstract


AIRCREWS ARE BEING INCREASINGLY SATURATED IN NEWER AIRCRAFT BY COGNITIVE WORKLOAD. THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO OVERWHELMING AN VOLUME AND RATE OF DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR IMPROVING WEAPON SYSTEMS AND EXPANDING THREAT ENVIRONMENT. IMPROVED DISPLAYS AND CONTROLS ARE NO LONGER ADEQUATE TO PERMIT AIRCREWS TO ADEQUATELY CONTEND WITH THEIR NEED TO ABSORB THE AVAILABLE DATA AND MAKE PROPER DECISIONS. ARTITICIAL INTELLLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY IS RAPIDLY SHOWING PROMISE OF PROVIDING A SOLUTION. ARTICICIAL INTELLIGENCE INCLUDES A NUMBER OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. THEIR GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO THE AIRCREW ENVIRONMENT IS NOT DEMONSTRATED. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN EVALUATION WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN REASONABLY BE APPLIED AND RECOMMEND INITIATIVES AND ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP THE POTENTIAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
