# Abstract


Enview is a leading 3D Geospatial Analytics (3DGA) company. We exist to protect people, critical infrastructure, and enhance national security by transforming nation-scale 3D geospatial data sets into insights and action. Enviews 3DGA Platform reveals what was previously invisible by fusing human and machine intelligence. We combine expertise in Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, 3D computer vision, and high-performance computing to allow energy and government customers to see the invisible and use todays data to predict future threats.We have proven commercial experience operationalizing AI analytics for the Energy industryincluding some of the worlds largest pipeline and powerline operators. These organizations, much like the Air Force, are tasked with monitoring, planning, and operating across massive geographic areas. They have invested heavily in the use of Remote Sensing to aid in this process, but are overwhelmed by the size and complexity of the data. Enviews innovative and advanced capabilities are unlocking the potential value in this dataat scale and speed. Our platform will help the Air Force ISR and Remote Sensing communities better leverage artificial intelligence to operate faster, across larger areas, with greater accuracy.
