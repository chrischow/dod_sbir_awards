# Abstract


PTFS will conduct research, perform analysis, and develop a prototype solution for AFDO to demonstrate how the EO 13526 declassification process can be semi-automated using technology to significantly improve productivity and accuracy. The prototype will be a complete solution allowing evaluation of the cradle to grave declassification process that currently starts with paper documents and ends with a decision to exempt, refer or declassify.The prototype will demonstrate how results from analyzing declassification decision making can be captured using technology to semi-automate declassification reviews. Key program milestones include:-Kickoff Meeting-Interviewing/observing AFDO personnel-Converting sample hardcopy paper to searchable PDFs-Creating and refining a semantic library of terms for semi-automating the declassification/referral process-Developing methodology to objectively rate OCR accuracy-Tuning Knowvation DX pattern search settings to obtain acceptable level of false positives-Using Knowvation DX to search document PDFs and highlight sensitive content-Technical Review-Using AFDO personnel toReview identical documents using manual and semi-automated techniquesValidate captured accuracy and productivity metricsCertify accuracy and productivity improvements-Demonstration to AFDO-Assess artificial intelligence applications for future integration, develop Knowvation DX machine-learning methodology-Develop Phase II pilot approach-Final Report, SF298
