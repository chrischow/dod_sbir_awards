Experiment Exploited, Simulation based, and Distributed Tool for Injury Assessment
==================================================================================

# Abstract


Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to develop an innovative tool for injury assessment that will systematically analyze and model huge amounts of experimental/simulation data in biodynamics by exploiting established injury models and criteria currently used. Our proposed tool will be developed from synergistic combination of experimental exploitation, simulation approximation, and distributed computation. Experimental exploitation tries to utilize the experimental data to the largest extent. Exploitation of this data includes the validation of some biomechanical simulations and interpolation inside the space of experimental data/extrapolation outside that space. Simulation approximation uses sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks to fit the experimental/simulation datasets between the scenario inputs and injury levels under various impacts. For computational efficiency, web wide access, generation of portable systems, will use a three-tiered distributed computational architecture whereby web browsers and portable devices will perform as clients, databases and large amount of caches as web servers, and parallel computers as computational servers empowering the web servers. The envisioned end-product of this SBIR effort will be distributed, accurate and rapid injury assessment tool which utilizes experimental data, different computer simulation programs, and various injury criteria and models which offer the capability of effective decision making in the battlefield.
