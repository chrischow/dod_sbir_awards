AVA- Analyst Virtual Assistant using Artificial Intelligence
============================================================

# Abstract


This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates and develops technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive machine intelligence that power commercial virtual assistant products like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa for the creation of a custom virtual assistant system, AVA (Analyst Virtual Assistant using Artificial Intelligence), that aids Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance human analysts. Specifically, Plasticitys prior work on virtual assistants will be applied to researching intent extraction systems, command and intent fulfillment systems and APIs, and machine intelligence frameworks for prediction that augment the work of human analysts and make information search, processing, and decision-making easier. The cohesive virtual assistant system developed will be customized, tailored, and portable for each analyst as they use the assistant over time, either proactively or by typing text in the console or through voice recognition. Furthermore, this proposal seeks to design and develop a technical feasibility study that will be completed at the end of Phase I to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AVA system in reducing the incredible information overload analysts feel today with the increasing complexity of processing, exploiting, analyzing, producing, disseminating, and decision-making based on ISR data.
