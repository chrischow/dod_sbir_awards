Wide-Field-Of-View Infrared Seeker
==================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT:  The U.S. Air Force has a need to develop small and agile strapdown (no-gimbal), wide-field-of-view (WFOV) seekers capable of precision guidance within cluttered urban environments. The Spectral Imaging Laboratory (SPILAB) proposes the development of both long wavelength infrared (LWIR) and middle wavelength infrared (MWIR) artificial compound eye (ACE) optical systems that can be coupled to LWIR and MWIR camera modules.  ACE wide angle optics have the benefit of generating high resolution, distortion free images that have uniform intensity across the field. The SPILAB ACE design includes a honeycomb louver baffle that can block stray radiation from bright sources such as the sun and flares.  BENEFIT:  Will provide the military with infrared wide angle seekers that can be used in small weapon/aircraft systems engaged in combat and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Commercial applications include surveillance activities in law enforcement, search and rescue, border control, and homeland security. Other commercial applications include machine vision for manufacturing, robotics, and vehicle situational awareness/safety systems.
