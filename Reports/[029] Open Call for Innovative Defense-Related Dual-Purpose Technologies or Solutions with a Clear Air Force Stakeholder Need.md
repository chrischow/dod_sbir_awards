# Abstract


The objective of the Bluestaq Space and Cyber Sentinel initiative is to provide the government and commercial industry with an autonomous service for rapid satellite and cyber network anomaly characterization.The Sentinel will employ advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) engines and Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) technologies to enable: continuous monitoring of thousands of real time feeds, building up normalcy patterns of life, and alerting operators to potentially serious issues.Similar to virus scanning software, the AI engines will be conditioned to learn patterns in the data that may be indicative of a multitude of root causes including extreme solar flare events, cyber-attacks, intentional/unintentional jamming, and software/hardware component failures.Operators will monitor the system through an intuitive web-based portal.The portal will display the various architectures and overlay current state-of-health data directly on element nodes.Sentinel will enable operators to graph all time-series information to explore historical trending behaviors.When the system detects an anomaly, it will graphically depict the various fault states the AI engine is considering and show what confidence level the system believes the highest probability fault condition is.With the Sentinel, space and cyber operators will have an unparalleled new active diagnostics tool to support critical mission operations.
