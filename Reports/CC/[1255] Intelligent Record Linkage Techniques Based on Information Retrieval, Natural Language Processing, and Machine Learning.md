Intelligent Record Linkage Techniques Based on Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning
=======================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The sheer magnitude of  information available online via the  Internet has overwhelmed the ability of existing search tools to produce useful query responses.   Current  web-search  techniques typically  fail  to correlate relevant documents that   areidentified in  different ways, such as synonyms and acronyms.  The challenge  is to find an approach that can  obtain highly accurate matches even  when those documents do not share any   obvious attributes with  the  query, and with  minimal informationrequirement  from the user.  The   objective of this STTR project is to develop an information management  system to rapidly and accurately linking  records  of   related information  from  web-based information  sources.  In Phase I  we plan to identify,implement, andevaluate  hybrid   approaches  for  cross-record   linkage,   using  a combination of machine  learning, information  retrieval, and  natural language processing  methodologies.  This will involve the integrationof  pre-processed outputs  of multiple  approaches for record  linkage into a significantly higher-quality result.    In particular, we  will investigate the  use of  selected statistical, Artificial Intelligence and  Neural Networks  techniques   forimproving the record   linkage performance of information management systems.  University of Maryland (Baltimore  County) will be the   research institute partner for  this effort,   under the direction   of    Professor Charles Nicholas,   aninternationally   recognized   expert   in information   retrieval and knowledge management. Commercial applications of the proposed technology include all private sector companies, federal and state  agencies who need to acquire  and manage large  amountof information in the  form of  text documents in order  to   stay   competitive  or efficient.   It   will   appeal  to knowledge-intensive businesses, small/medium     companies, individual consultants, universities  and   federal   research institutesas  acost-effective alternative to  traditional database or  web search and match engines.
