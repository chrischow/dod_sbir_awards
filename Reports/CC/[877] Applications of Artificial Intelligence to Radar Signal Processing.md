Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Radar Signal Processing
==================================================================

# Abstract


The Army has two comprehensive workstation based programs for the processing of data collected by its instrumentation radars.  One program is based on the TMR technology for processing one-dimensional data and the other is based on the CIA technology for processing two-dimensional data.  Both of these interactive programs are capable of extracting considerable information about the motion and dynamics of targets, but only under the guidance of an experienced analyst.  The objective of the proposed effort is to incorporate expert system tools into these programs to reduce the tedium in the processing of data, to enable users with less experience to be productive, and to produce more reliable results. Some of these expert system tools already exist in other programs developed for target identification, so that the proposed effort should be of relatively low risk.  BENEFITS:  The existing workstation based software is already being sold in the commercial marketplace.  The expert system enhancements developed in the proposed effort should create additional demand for the software.
