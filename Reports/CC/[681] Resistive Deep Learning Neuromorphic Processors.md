Resistive Deep Learning Neuromorphic Processors
===============================================

# Abstract


Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have many applications in satellites and are generally quite compute intensive. The objective of this work is to develop highly Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) efficient neuromorphic processors that can run AI algorithms. We will develop resistive crossbar neuromorphic processors, with the primary target being deep learning algorithms. We plan to process various types of signals very efficiently ndash; these include sensor and cognitive communication applications. The key outcomes of the work will be the processor design, processor performance metrics on various applications, and software for the processor.
