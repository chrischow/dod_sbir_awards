MISTec: Military Information Superiority Technology
===================================================

# Abstract


Design Interactive Inc. (DI) proposes development of the Military Information Superiority Technology (MISTec), an adaptive and automated information prioritization and management system that facilitates optimal usage of networking and computing resources for promoting operational SA in modernized command conditions. MISTec integrates data analytics and human performance engineering methods to enable Information Superiority despite the reduction in physical resources and computing power associated with mobile command posts. MISTec will be a custom-built dynamic message priority queuing technology, providing role-specific and situation-specific prioritized information at the point of need by establishing goal-oriented information requirements and applying data analytic algorithms to inform on information and asset priorities. MISTec complements efforts to reduce vulnerabilities of large, static command posts through size reduction by facilitating effective and efficient information collection, flow, and storage. Phase I seeks to identify the factors relevant to the dynamic prioritization of battlespace data and information, and to present those prioritizations across several use cases. Proof-of-concept demonstration will be completed via walkthrough of a theoretical prioritization methodology that illustrates representative data sources and demonstrates the prioritization rules and schemes for adapting priority levels over the course of an evolving situation. Utility of the solution will be demonstrated in representative use cases.
