PROBABILISTIC EXTENSIONS TO MODEL BASED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
=============================================================

# Abstract


A probabilistic programming/modeling language will be developed and maintained as an open source project. A broad based open source community will be cultivated to support, extend, and manage the core language. A compilation system that has knowledge of certain machine learning algorithms will be developed as a compilation back end system.
