An Assessment Methodology for Effects Based Operations
======================================================

# Abstract


In accordance with the requirements of the solicitation, we will design, prototype, and demonstrate an Effects Assessment (EA) tool which provides the capabilities to: • Visualize the links between effects, the actions planned to achieve those effects, and the resources assigned to those actions; • Decompose effects into MoEIs, i.e., the observable impacts of actions; • Roll-up, aggregate, or combine MoEIs to evaluate MoEs and assess overall effect accomplishment; • Determine if accomplishment of an effect is on track, i.e., identify trends and patterns from MoEIs and use this information to describe the likelihood of effect accomplishment; • Assess MoPs and compare actual versus planned performance; • Interface with ISR and operations reports to capture data relevant to MoP and MoE assessment; • Maintain the neutrality status of resources; • Interface with artificial intelligence and data mining tools to extract and automatically monitor data relevant to MoPs and MoEIs. Our tool will take advantage of current capabilities in the areas of data mining / knowledge discovery, visualization, and model-based estimation, and will draw heavily from our hands-on EA experience with users in the field, notably US Forces Korea, and with leading EA research organizations, e.g., DARPA and JFCOM.
