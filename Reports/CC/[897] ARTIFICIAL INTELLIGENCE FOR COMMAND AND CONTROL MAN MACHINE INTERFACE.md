ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR COMMAND AND CONTROL MAN MACHINE INTERFACE
=====================================================================

# Abstract


THE TACTICS AND DOCTRINE OF THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD DICTATE THE NEED FOR INTELLIGENT MACHINES TO ASSIST HUMAN OPERATORS. THE TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH ENCAPSULATING THE KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TO CAPTURE THE REASONING PROCESS THAT HUMAN EXPERTS PERFORM WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FUTURE COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR THE MILITARY. EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INTELLIGENT MACHINES IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT A BATTLEFIELD ANALYST, UNTRAINED IN THE USE OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, BE ABLE TO USE THE DEVICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP A MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE, THROUGH HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING, TO ENABLE AN INTELLIGENCE ANALYST UNTRAINED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE TO MAKE USE OF RECENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES APPLICABLE TO BATTLEFIELD MANAGEMENT.
