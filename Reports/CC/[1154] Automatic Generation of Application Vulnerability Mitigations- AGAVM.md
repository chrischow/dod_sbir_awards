Automatic Generation of Application Vulnerability Mitigations- AGAVM
====================================================================

# Abstract


Seed Innovations proposes to design and develop a proof-of-concept system, the Automatic Generation of Application Vulnerability Mitigations (AGAVM), that will automatically generate source code level mitigations to potential vulnerabilities in application software based on weaknesses identified by commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) static code analysis tools. AGAVM features a plug-in architecture, applies modern techniques including inference, automatic code generation, machine leaning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods for recognizing and mitigating software vulnerabilities at the source code level to help ensure the integrity of military information infrastructure and help protect the warfighter against cyber threats. Approved for Public Release | 19-MDA-10270 (18 Nov 19)
