# Abstract


Dynamic Intelligence Anticipation, Prioritization, and Exploitation System, or DIAPES.  DIAPES combines an innovative application of ontology modeling, intelligence data integration; artificial intelligence techniques; and visualization to allow analysts to rapidly solve intelligence requirements in support of complete Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) while compressing the ATO cycle. The goal of this research is to develop and demonstrate a prototype system.
