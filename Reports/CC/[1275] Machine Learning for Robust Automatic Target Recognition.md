Machine Learning for Robust Automatic Target Recognition
========================================================

# Abstract


The primary issue faced by ATR systems center around the large   "variability of the ATR problem space spanned by the targets,  sensors, and the environment and the associated challenge is to  develop "robust" approaches to improve ATR system performance.    Addressing this challenge, the objectives of this project (Phases I  and II) are an investigation and demonstration of prototype algorithms  to improve ATR robustness.  A common theme underlying robust decision  making algorithms is learning from real data which can be accomplished  by propagation, interaction, and switching amongst multiple models  leading to composite or generalized global models that provide robust  and reliable estimates and ATR decisions.  We will develop both  statistical learning and machine learning based approaches for robust  ATR This project will also involve a series of demonstrations, where  generalization is conducted over EOC conditions at both the raw data  (pixel/intensity) level, and the feature level.  Testing at these  various levels will account for EOC factors, including clutter and  noise variations, minor design differences, pose, revetment, partial  obscurations, and articulation of movable parts, etc.    The project team consists of Scientific Systems Company, Inc. (SSCI),  Woburn MA, and its subcontractor Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems  (LMTS), Eagan MN.
