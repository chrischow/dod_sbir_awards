Automated Net Centric Fires Management using Artificial Intelligence Techniques
===============================================================================

# Abstract


The major opportunity we present is our substantial intelligent planning and scheduling experience and existing customizable intelligent planning, resource selection, and scheduling architecture along with our in-depth knowledge of combined arms fires and effects planning, integration, coordination, and deconfliction and FCS capabilities.  We propose, ultimately, the development of an Intelligent FCS Fires Management System (IFFMS), integrated with the FCS System-of-systems Common Operating Environment (SoSCOE) which monitors the position and status of net centric fires related weapon systems and sensors and  the position and status of observed enemy units and assets, receives existing plans and requests for fire support and fire missions, generates fire plans (including routes) to best meet the requests, and performs the necessary fires integration, coordination, and deconfliction.    In Phase I we will explore the net centric fires and effects planning, coordination, integration, and deconfliction process with current operational experts and those familiar with FCS, elaborate the artificial intelligence techniques useful for automating the planning/resource selection/scheduling/conflict resolution process, capture the planning, coordination, integration, and deconfliction knowledge needed to generate optimized, correct plans, investigate FCS SoSCOE integration requirements, prove the feasibility of these techniques through prototype development, and develop the Phase II system specification for IFFMS.
