High Performance MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit for Missile Systems
===================================================================

# Abstract


The proposed project aims to improve the SWaP-C of tactical-grade IMUs for use in the navigation system of guided weapons. Spectral Energies and its partners will achieve this goal by using advanced machine learning algorithms to reduce error in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) MEMS IMUs. 1. Immediate benefits to MDA: The proposed product would provide an IMU to the DOD with comparable precision and accuracy to that of current state-of-the-art IMUs with significant cost-savings. Current estimates suggest that our proposed IMU could cost an order of magnitude less than current options. In addition, the improved SWaP-C of our proposed IMU could allow weapon systems with increased payload or improved range. 2. Scientific discovery: The proposed work would result in new machine learning methods for error modeling and mitigation. These methods could be used to better understand error propagation and used to improve error modeling in many systems. 3. Economic security and prosperity: Spectral Energies believe that a successful MEMS IMU could provide it with significant economic benefits. It is currently working with multiple partners who would have interest in using the developed technology in their systems and an initial market analysis suggests that the potential product could generate up to $9.5 million in sales in a few years.
