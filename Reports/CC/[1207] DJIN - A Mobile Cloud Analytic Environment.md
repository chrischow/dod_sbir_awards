DJIN: A Mobile Cloud Analytic Environment
=========================================

# Abstract


Forward deployed units rely on locally sensed data from a variety of sensors to achieve and maintain situational awareness during operations.Due to its size, the bulk of these data are streamed to rear echelon analysis centers for processing in large compute facilities, introducing time delays and loss of detail due to the limited comms available in the field.We propose to eliminate the need for high bandwidth comms and provide improvements in analytical responsiveness and completeness by moving large scale processing capability forward to the deployed unit using commercially available hardware and a software environment that enables big data analytics to run on a variety of devices that operate and appear as a single large cloud computer.
