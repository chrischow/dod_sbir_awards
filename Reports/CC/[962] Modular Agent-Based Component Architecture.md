Modular Agent-Based Component Architecture
==========================================

# Abstract


The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a decision aid tool that provides for the management and arbitration of data flow between fielded assets. Our solution will act as a decision aid to support situational awareness on the battlefield. Assets can be coordinated efficiently since decision-makers and dismounted units alike will have access to the full situational picture. Our solution will assure interoperability between assets such as multiple field-based robotic platforms and robotic controllers by: 1) Creating the software translators between several fielded data formats including Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS), Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF), and High Level Architecture (HLA) to enable interoperation of tactical elements, and 2) Integrating an Intelligent Agent framework to enable a variety of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g. Bayesian Belief Networks, Constraint Propagation Programming, expert systems) to aid in data management and display tasks. Results of the Phase II effort will be a demonstration system consisting of several robotic platforms whose sensor data is transmitted to a tool called the Tactical Data Aggregator (TDA), which will provide the Common Operations Picture (COP), and be compatible with the Global Information Grid via System of Systems Common Operating Environment (SOSCOE) interfaces.
