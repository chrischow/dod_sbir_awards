FishEye Intelligent Dynamic Data Logging
========================================

# Abstract


The Phase II project combines existing innovative machine data collection with machine learning to create an Intelligent Dynamic Data Logging system that enables MDA to increase the volume of simulation executions to tens of thousands or more annually. Data logging is a foundational component of missile defense simulation but applies to other industries and markets. Examples include self-driving vehicles that collect multisensory data and crash forensics; aircraft “black boxes” enabling analysis of unexpected events; and instrumentation of the Internet of Things across large numbers of small devices to understand overall performance. These numerous commercial and defense applications can all benefit from meaningful data collection and improve their overall system performance through Intelligent Dynamic Data logging.
