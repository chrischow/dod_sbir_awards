DRAGONS â€“ Dynamic Resource Allocation Gains for Operational Networked Sharing
===============================================================================

# Abstract


Sharing platforms have already transformed some sectors of civilian logistics, promoting the efficient utilization of resources, such as cars and bicycles. Sharing resources is particularly desirable when those resources are costly, and high utilization is critical, characteristics often observed in military settings. In order to address specific constraints imposed by military applications on resource sharing, DRAGONS offers an innovative class of reservation algorithms, leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to improve the state-of-the-art solutions from processing networks and appointment scheduling. DRAGONS is an integrated platform for data management and resource reservation, with capability to coordinate resource utilization in complex environments to minimize idleness, while implementing online controls that yield adequate prioritization with quality of service guarantees. It is expected to have major impact on operations efficiency and cost reduction, in military and commercial applications.
