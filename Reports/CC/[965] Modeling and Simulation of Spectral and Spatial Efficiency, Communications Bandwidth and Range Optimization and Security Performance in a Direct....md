# Abstract


RKF Engineering proposes the development of a software simulation system for designing, analyzing, testing and optimizing dynamic, on the move, directional networks.  The proposed system will accept target design goals, concepts and constraints and sequentially analyze all aspects of the communications system and control all components of the environment.  A graphical programming language interface will facilitate quick scenario and network setup.  Visualization and interactive capabilities will allow the user to monitor and guide the design progress.  Central to this software simulation tool will be a cognitive engine that will automatically examine candidate architectures and approaches leading to the optimal network design that meets the required objectives.  With hundreds or potentially thousands of free parameters the design optimization will be extremely difficult and will have to rely on one or more advanced artificial intelligence approaches to develop candidate designs.
