Vibration-Enhanced Sensing of Buried Landmines
==============================================

# Abstract


Vadum proposes to mature its Vibration-Enhanced Underground Sensing (VENUS) technology into a reliable, shallow-buried low-metal-content landmine discrimination and classification solution with minimal False Alarm Rate (FAR).  VENUS exploits a novel vibration phenomenology to provide unique discriminatory information and estimated classification of the buried target that enhances and complements other landmine detection sensors operating in traditional modes.  The low size, weight, and power (SWAP) sensor facilitates VENUS integration into a mine clearance system of systems solution as a standalone unit or as a sensor-fused enhancement to existing anti-personnel (AP) mine detectors by leveraging common sensor components.  In Sequential Phase-II, Vadum will upgrade the existing VENUS system to achieve the desired detection depth and integrate machine learning-based buried target classification with validated testing at TRL-6.  To complement the design effort, North Carolina State University (NCSU) will expand its state-of-the-art predictive models for multi-physics interactions between the VENUS system and complex, buried targets.
