# Abstract


Chooch AI is a patented, ready-now, visual artificial intelligence technology platform that provides object detection and recognition, image and object segmentation, annotation, labeling, dense classification, and semantic analysis (contextual perceptions) of images both passive and dynamic. System generated metadata can be synchronized across existing networks thereby increasing the speed of human-on-the-loop decision cycles and event-driven outcomes.  Chooch AI has several distinct advantages over competing technologies. First, Chooch AI is a singularly integrated network of neural networks with over 115 detection, recognition, and evaluation models, including change and anomaly detection. Second, Chooch AI has approximately 200,000 pre-trained object, image, and facial classes. Third, Chooch AI is extremely versatile, offering a broad range of deployment options from a single Edge processing device to unlimited desktop terminals serviced from the cloud or on-premise network. Fourth, Chooch AI training, integration, scale, and support is market leading for both simplicity and completeness. Finally, Chooch AI provides a Dashboard interface to train and visualize outcomes, create alerts, reports, and conduct remote deployments onto Chooch Edge AI devices for the end-user. Chooch AI's object and image segmentation enables users to distinguish objects of interest from background imagery in static and FMV feed. This process eliminates noise (clutter) in images and significantly increases the accuracy in training and predictions. Once images are segmented, Chooch AI applies a combination of neural networks to recognize objects, faces, and actions to the highest degrees of accuracy followed by tagging of ALL objects within a scene. Chooch AI Facial Recognition technology includes liveness detection, detects spoof and deep fake attempts, and has recently been evaluated at 'State-of-the-Art’ performance by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) 1:1 testing. Chooch AI is hardware, operating system, sensor, and light spectrum agnostic. Chooch AI can recognize objects in Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) FMV. For on-premise or in-theatre processing, Chooch AI can reside at ground stations, tactical or emergency operations centers. These locations can be connected with existing mesh network technologies and communications architecture to provide uninterrupted visual data processing and updates to the network.
