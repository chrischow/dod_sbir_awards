Beliefs, Values, Interests and Practices of Identities, Networks, Groups for Planning &amp; Analysis
====================================================================================================

# Abstract


The intelligence community still cannot satisfactorily answer critical fundamental preparation, planning, and execution questions about the environment in which US and allied forces operate and the people they seek to persuade. There is a vast amount of information, almost all of it unclassified, which characterizes population identities and interrelationships in terms of beliefs, values, interests and practices. Securboration, teaming with recognized experts in military planning, human geography, and academic research propose to develop CORPUS - Characterization of Open Resources for Planning and Understanding Strategies (CORPUS). CORPUS leverages and extends innovative text analytics and machine learning to analyze open source intelligence (OSINT) to understand the implications of socio-cultural beliefs values, and interest on mission preparation, planning and execution. This includes a broad set of analysis methods from cognitive anthropology and other social sciences, such as Cultural Domain Analysis (CDA), Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), Geographical analysis (GIS), and statistical analysis. The resulting CORPUS will strengthen existing products by (1) discovering new information and relationships that cut across disciplines (spatial and behavioral) (2) converging on the most relevant information for their domain and information requirements (3) discovering previously unknown concepts  and (4) understanding relationships among socio-cultural dynamics and societal institutions.
