# Abstract


Aircraft maintenance is a critical component of mission readiness and force projection for the United States Military. It is also a time intensive expertise dependent process that can lead to a lot of human errors. Because of the team's over a decade expertise in this subject matter, United Aircraft Technologies, Inc. is developing a novel Augmented Reality Monitoring and Fault Localization System (called ARMS) for wire harness maintenance management and maintenance training that replaces a metal legacy design with a new ergonomic and considerably lighter alternative. Built with Smart Interconnecting Clamps (ICC), ARMS is designed for 3D visualization of the aircraft wiring integrity through the use of integrated sensors and algorithms. ARMS leverages high volumes of data obtained by the ICC sensors to create better computing models for predictions of wiring maintenance, fault identification, and repair through the use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Augmented Reality (AR)-enabled smart solution destined to save time during wiring predictive maintenance.
