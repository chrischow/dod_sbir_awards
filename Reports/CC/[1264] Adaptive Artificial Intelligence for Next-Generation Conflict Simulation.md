Adaptive Artificial Intelligence for Next-Generation Conflict Simulation
========================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is for the design and development of a challenging, adaptable, and extendible A/I system for use in state-of-the-art computer-based wargames.  The development will result in a 3rd generation computer wargame based on modern air power conflictand the ability to apply the technology developed for this project in other wargames ranging from tactical ground-based warfare to naval conflict and others.  The approach will use state-of-the-art A/I technologies programmed into A/I components whichthrough well-defined interfaces will allow for a plug-and-play A/I system.  This will provide for unlimited future development and enhancement.  The results of this proposal can be used in numerous commercial wargames either released by the proposer orunder development.  It will enhance and improve the commercial potential of these games and result in higher sales and revenue.  On the military side, the results of this proposal will provide a highly flexible and extensible AI for military training andplanning.  Both the military student and the military planner will benefit from the more challenging A/I opponent developed from this proposal.
