Ensemble Prediction for Intelligent Combat Casualty Care (EPIC3)
================================================================

# Abstract


Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) is the difference between life or death following injury on the battlefield. First responders, combat medics, and casualty evacuation medics perform vital TC3 roles but are often overburdened by multiple casualties and overwhelmed by an increasing excess of sensor data that can be difficult to interpret in stressful and chaotic environments. Furthermore, injuries can be difficult to identify when symptoms are not obvious and treatment can be difficult to perform, depending on the skill of the performer. To address these challenges, we propose to design and evaluate Ensemble Prediction for Intelligent Combat Casualty Care (EPIC3), a mobile application that uses an ensemble of classifiers, frequently tuned via machine learning, to predict life-threatening and difficult-to-detect injuries. We will present the steps to treat those injuries through a simple, easy to use interface that tailors itself to the needs and skill level of the user.
