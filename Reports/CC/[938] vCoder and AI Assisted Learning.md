vCoder and AI Assisted Learning
===============================

# Abstract


The researchers will further develop their existing vCoder, an immersive virtual reality (VR) game for students to learn to code. This project will develop an artificial intelligence component to customize pathways to optimize how individual students learn to code. At the end of Phase I, in a pilot study with a middle school class, the researchers will examine whether the prototype functions as planned; if the VR experience adjusts to the level of knowledge and skill of each student; and if students' engagement, knowledge, and coding skill increases pre- to post-intervention.
