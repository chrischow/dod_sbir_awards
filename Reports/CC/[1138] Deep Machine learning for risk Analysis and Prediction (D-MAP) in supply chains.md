Deep Machine learning for risk Analysis and Prediction (D-MAP) in supply chains
===============================================================================

# Abstract


There is an need to collect sufficient knowledge on DoD defense systems and services supply bases, analyze and predict risks in supply chains, and take risk mitigation approaches to improve supply chains. To address this need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to design and implement the D-MAP system with the following novel components: 1) Data management module automatically collects raw data from multiple data sources, improves data quality, merges and processes raw data to obtain both features and ground truth to facilitate further analysis; 2) Data analytics module analyzes the supply chain data via advanced machine learning techniques to predict future risks; 3) Risk identification module identifies risks based on mission requirements and discovers new risks from data analysis results; and 4) Risk mitigation module recommends approaches to mitigate risks such that a supply chain can be improved to meet its mission requirements.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9219 (31 May 17)
