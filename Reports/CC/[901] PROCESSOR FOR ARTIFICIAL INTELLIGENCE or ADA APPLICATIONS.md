PROCESSOR FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/ADA APPLICATIONS
======================================================

# Abstract


A PROJECT IS PROPOSED WHICH WILL INVESTIGATE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A 32-BIT MILITARIZED PROCESSING MODULE WITH AN INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE THAT WILL EFFICIENTLY PERFORM BOTH AI AND ADA-TYPE PROCESSING AND BE COMPATIBLE WITH APPLICABLE BACKPANEL BUS STANDARDS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL RESEARCH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MICROPROCESSORS WHOSE ARCHITECTURES LEND THEMSELVES TOWARD EXTENSIBILITY OF AI/ADA FEATURES THROUGH THE USE OF CUSTOM VLSI CHIPS. AFTER EXAMINING ARCHITECTURE, EXECUTION PARADIGMS, AND PRINCIPAL APPLICATIONS OF AI/ADA MACHINES, AN IMPLEMENTATION AND TEST PLAN WILL BE FORMULATED TO MEET FUNCTIONAL, EFFICIENCY, AND SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY REQUIREMENTS.
