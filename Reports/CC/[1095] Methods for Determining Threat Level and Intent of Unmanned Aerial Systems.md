Methods for Determining Threat Level and Intent of Unmanned Aerial Systems
==========================================================================

# Abstract


Spectral Sciences Inc. (SSI) in collaboration with SRC Inc. proposes to develop a Counter UAS Electro-optical Sensor (CUES) to address the need for an intelligent, multidimensional, compact, tripod-mounted system that can search, detect, identify, track and determine the intent and threat level of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). CUES provides an innovative combination of SSI’s four-dimensional (4D) imager with SRC’s state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, resulting in a sensor system for UAS detection and tracking that learns how to associate UAS features and behavior with intent. An infrared optical sensor that simultaneously generates spatial, spectral, and acoustic images will be developed, based on SSI’s proven hyperspectral/hypertemporal imaging technology. The sensor’s multidimensional output will provide data to deep learning bio-inspired AI data processing algorithms for analysis. The unique combination of capabilities will allow rapid target acquisition followed by on-board processing of multidimensional data, leading to quick decision-making on the intent and threat level of the monitored UAS, or a swarm of UASs.
