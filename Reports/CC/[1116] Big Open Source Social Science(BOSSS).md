Big Open Source Social Science(BOSSS)
=====================================

# Abstract


Big Open-Source Social Science (BOSSS) collects, manages, and exploits meaningful information extracted from unstructured and structured data and provides machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) solutions to improve the U.S. military’s understanding of populations involved in or impacted by military operations. In this Sequential Phase II, we will harden the BOSSS software, implement Army Synthetic Training Environment (STE)-compatible APIs to enable interoperability with multiple simulation tools, and integrate BOSSS into STE workflows. We will define and implement a common data format to represent the complex and dynamic human landscape. We will develop automated analytical tools encompassing all eight operational variables (political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, information, physical environment, and time). We will conduct a series of user juries to validate BOSSS’s utility and functionality. At the end of this effort, BOSSS will provide localized, social-science-based situation awareness data-as-a-service via REST APIs to multiple tools (e.g., OWT, VR Forces, S/SVT, TMT, TSS, OneSAF, etc.).
