Advancing Training Techniques of Non-Invasive 3-Dimensional Ultrasound Sound Technologies for both Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications
==========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Ultrasound is known to be an excellent imaging modality for trauma cases due to its portability and versatility.  These factors allow ultrasound to be particularly suitable for battlefield imaging and diagnoses. However, the modest display technology and lack of intelligent systems do not allow battlefield ultrasound to live up to its true potential.  In this work, UtopiaCompression proposes the development of a novel three-dimensional hand-held display device and analysis package that is powered by artificial intelligence and highly sophisticated adaptive models of external and internal anatomy that will dramatically increase the diagnostic power of battlefield ultrasound.  Using this non-invasive diagnostice imaging technology, a medic would be able to gain and utilize information that is currently either unappreciated or simply unavailable.  The power of this medical diagnostic imaging system stems from its adaptive capabilities and its intelligence in localizing anatomy of interest with respect to certain anatomic landmarks and displaying and recognizing known patterns and classifications of normal and abnormal anatomy.  Furthermore, given this intelligence at display and localization and the ability of the system to guide even inexperienced users to acquire diagnostically useful views, the training times of medics performing medical ultrasound on the battlefield should be greatly reduced.  Overall, this system should allow a low cost, highly efficient, and well integrated diagnostic ultrasound system whereby the user is more efficiently engaged with the scanning hardware and imaging tasks. The anticipated result of this research is to produce a user friendly intelligent visual anatomic guidance/decision support system/device backed by an effective 3D modeling and visualization technology that can significantly assist army medics in their ultrasound training and decision making.
