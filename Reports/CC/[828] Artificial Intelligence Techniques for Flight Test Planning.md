Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Flight Test Planning
===========================================================

# Abstract


We propose an innovatiave combination of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve the Navy's capabilities and reduce the time required for flight test plan representation and development, and flight data analysis. These capabilities will be available as part of an integrated workstation toolbed. Specifically, we will use AI knowledge representations including frames, semantic networks and rules for capturing plan requirements, components and constraints. We will facilitate plan design through the use of the intelligent entities concept and similarity-based techniques, techniques we have used with much success for the complex planning of NASA's Space Shuttle missions. We will enhance the Navy's data analysis capabilities through the application of similarity-based techniques coupled with data reduction techniques. Finally, we will develop a model for integration of existing and emerging flight test planning software, expert systems, data base management systems and data reduction systems. Navy flight test planning has not previously been comprehensively automated and no one before has applied similarity-based techniques to flight test plan development. Phase I research and prototype development will lay the groundwork for the Phase II implementation of an automated planning and data analysis system and the eventual commercialization of the planning system.
