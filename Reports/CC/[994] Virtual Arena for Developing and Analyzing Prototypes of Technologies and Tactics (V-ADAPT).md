Virtual Arena for Developing and Analyzing Prototypes of Technologies and Tactics (V-ADAPT)
===========================================================================================

# Abstract


Early Synthetic Prototyping seeks to streamline the design and procurement process of equipment and vehicles by utilizing scientists, engineers, and warfighter end users to design and verify equipment in the conceptual stages in a virtual environment. Despite the numerous benefits in such an approach, a serious challenge is how to exploit the data generated in virtual battlespace scenarios. DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) proposes to meet this challenge by developing the Virtual Arena for Designing and Analyzing Prototypes of Technology and Tactics (V-ADAPT) system. V-ADAPT will learn individual and group tactics that are used by soldiers in virtual battlefields to accomplish missions; in addition, it will determine the optimal actions maximizing probability of mission success. The system will facilitate rapid data analysis by automatically displaying only the most relevant and interesting visualizations to analysts and engineers. In summary, V-ADAPT will provide a solution to quantify soldier behavior, display relevant behavior relationships to analysts, and provide understanding of what behaviors lead to mission success. DACs success will hinge on our previous experience in machine learning, unstructured data analysis, multimodal data fusion, and data relationship for customers such as the Army, Missile Defense Agency, Air Force, and Office of Naval Research.
