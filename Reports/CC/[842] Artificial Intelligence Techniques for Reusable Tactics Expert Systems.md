Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Reusable Tactics Expert Systems
======================================================================

# Abstract


We will develop a general schema for naval warfare tactics  representation using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Expert  System technology to capture the human decision processes.   Since the representation and automatic execution of tactics is a  complex problem we will take an integrated approach using a  variety of AI techniques. These techniques include  knowledge-based representations (rules, objects), case-based  reasoning, and intelligent entities, techniques we have used  with much success in previous projects.  We will use an  object-oriented (00) paradigm to make the tactics knowledge  highly portable and reusable across different simulations.  The  primary goal is implementation of portable tactics expert  systems for use with different simulations. The general nature  of the schema will be demonstrated by an investigation of  several domains, and prototype implementations in two. We will  devise a method of compiling the knowledge in the general  representation schema into a highly efficient runtime form for  rapid execution, which can be easily hosted on different  platforms and readily interfaced to existing simulations.
