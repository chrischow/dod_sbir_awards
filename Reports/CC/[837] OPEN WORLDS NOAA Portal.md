OPEN WORLDS NOAA Portal
=======================

# Abstract


Many people recognize how critical it is to understand our weather, climate, and environment. Educators already use NOAA data and models in working with students and their communities as part of their teaching and outreach. With the exponential growth in data, however, many of them struggle with accessing and managing that data. Evolving data formats and computing requirements make it very challenging. NOAA’s mission is critical. We must find better ways to make NOAA’s data more accessible and usable to educators who are teaching our next generation of decision makers. For the value of the data to be recognized, it must be used – and not just by data scientists. Michigan Aerospace and its partners propose to develop a web-based Portal with tools that greatly simplify access and use of NOAA data. We are passionate about providing educators and the general public with better access to this data and we believe NOAA’s mission is essential. The Portal will highlight the value of NOAA’s mission in meeting challenges that impact our daily lives. We will build upon our PLAIT.AI platform for monitoring watershed health. The Portal will allow users to ingest, process, visualize, and apply machine learning tools to NOAA data.
