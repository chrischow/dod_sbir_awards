Electronic Component Fingerprinting to Determine Manufacturing Origin
=====================================================================

# Abstract


The complexity of the global supply chain for microelectronic parts poses difficulties in the identification of manufacturing sources by DoD buyers.  ChromoLogic LLC proposes Electrical Component Manufacturing Origin Determination (ECMO) to provide customers with a rapid, unambiguous method to classify electronic components by fabrication facility.  The proposed system is comprised of a Raman spectroscopy subsystem for the collection of characteristic spectroscopic chemical signals from electronic components and a software subsystem for signal processing, error correction, and classification of sample parts within a manufacturing origin data library.  Matching of sample parts to the library is based on an automated machine learning framework accessed through a GUI interface.  The system is capable of use by non-experts without advanced training in spectroscopic techniques.  ECMO output is accompanied by a statistical decision support framework to provide users with classification results and the degree of certainty in the determination of manufacturing origin.
