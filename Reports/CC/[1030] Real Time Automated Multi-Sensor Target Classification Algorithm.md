Real Time Automated Multi-Sensor Target Classification Algorithm
================================================================

# Abstract


The Army is seeking a classification capability using existing, configured imaging sensors for their High Energy Laser Mobile Tactical Truck (HELMTT). Aret Associates proposes a robust innovative classification processing timeline that integrates image processing and tracking, extensive feature generation and extraction, temporal processing and classification using a machine learning architecture. Phase I focuses on collecting appropriate imaging data of many UAV target types for development and evaluation. Other targets of interest will be addressed in the option with existing simulation capabilities and data when available.
