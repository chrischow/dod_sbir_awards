Mitigation of GMTI Radar False Alarms Due to Wind-Blown Foliage with Machine Learning Techniques
================================================================================================

# Abstract


Solid State Scientific Corporation (SSSC) is pleased to submit a proposal that will significantly improve clutter rejection in Army Airborne Radars. SSSC will use prior work on an innovative Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) algorithm and adapt it to perform for Army requirements. The algorithm features applying both expertise in Radar and Deep Learning in order to improve clutter rejection without sacrificing the probability of detection.
