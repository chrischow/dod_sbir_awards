PROPERTIES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
=====================================

# Abstract


DR. KARL PRIBRAM OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY HAS HYPOTHESIZED A HOLOGRAPHICMECHANISM FOR THE STORAGE OF MEMORIES IN THE MAMALIAN BRAIN. OPTICAL HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS HAVE EXHIBITED THE ABILITY TO ASSOCIATE COMPLEX PATTERNS, TO CORRELATE COMPLEX PATTERNS, AND, THUS, TO RECOGNIZE AND TRACK COMPLEX VISUAL OBJECTS. THE QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED BY THIS PROPOSED BASIC RESEARCH IS THE FOLLOWING: CAN AN OPTICAL HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEM EXHIBIT FUNDAMENTAL PRIMITIVES WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR HIGHER LEVEL COGNITION? THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES THE POSSIBILITY OF JUST SUCH A DEMONSTRATION. SINCE THIS RESEARCH DEALS WITH FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF COGNITION, IT COULD HAVE FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELDS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, AND EVEN NEUROPHYSIOLOGY.
