StepWise Virtual Tutor for Common Core Algebra I
================================================

# Abstract


This project team will develop and test a prototype of the StepWise Virtual Tutor, designed to be an artificial intelligence software tutoring program for Algebra I students. The tutor will track students as they answer questions, catch algebraic and arithmetic errors, provides hints, and aggregate reports in an instructor dashboard. In the Phase I pilot research with 100 Algebra I middle and high school students, the researchers will examine whether the prototype functions as planned, whether students receive useful feedback, and whether teachers find the reports useful for informing practice.
