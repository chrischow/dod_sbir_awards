Networked Intelligent Agents and Distributed Decision Aids for Net Centric Fires
================================================================================

# Abstract


Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Networked Intelligent Agents and Distributed Decision Aids (NIADDA) for net centric fires.  The proposed NIADDA system will consist of three major modules:  real-time intelligent agents module for real time cognitive decision aids facilitating rule engines, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, artificial intelligence and soft computing; Web-based user interface module using document automation and Web-based Internet protocols; and cross-platform API (application programming interface) module that will be coded with reusable code base, i.e. C++, which will significantly decrease development time for future Army applications.  The intelligent agents module is configurable and customizable to create specialized intelligent agents to accomplish their tasks, as a key component in the NIADDA.  The NIADDA capabilities can be used via both Web Services and API.  In Phase I POC will demonstrate functionality and reusability through simulation and performance assessment.  The innovative NIADDA applications will provide the basis for developing next generation intelligent agents for network centric fires, to support application component development in Phase II.  In Phase II we will develop detailed component design and component API specifications, implement software and application scenarios, and provide complete documentation of the NIADDA techniques, analyses, and demonstration results.
