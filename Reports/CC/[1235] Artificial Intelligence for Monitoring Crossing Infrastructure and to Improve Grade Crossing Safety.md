Artificial Intelligence for Monitoring Crossing Infrastructure and to Improve Grade Crossing Safety
===================================================================================================

# Abstract


Founded in 2004, the mission of Wi-Tronix is to improve railway safety, operational efficiency, and service reliability, in real-time. We are the preferred connected solutions provider to over one-third of all
locomotives in North America.
Wi-Tronix is proposing to leverage our expertise in developing and making commercially available AI based technologies for autonomous highway-rail grade crossing inspections. Wi-Tronix seeks to develop AI models for monitoring the status of crossing infrastructure assets such as gates and lights. In cooperation with a Class I railroad, this project will leverage currently installed IoT Platforms equipped with video image recording. The project will focus on a limited number of active public crossings in the US for AI model development and validation.
The Wi-Tronix team is composed of railroad experts, data scientist and camera hardware experts. We have developed multiple AI models using imagery from both inward and outward facing cameras. These models
provide benefits from an overall network safety perspective. With our past experience and versatile expertise, the team expects to produce feasible and practical outcomes for evaluating autonomous grade crossing infrastructure monitoring.
