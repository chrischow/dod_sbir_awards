ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR THREAT WARNING SYSTEMS
==================================================

# Abstract


THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF FINITE INDUCTIVE SEQUENCE PROCESSING (FISP) TO PROVIDE FOR SMART THREAT SENSOR SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSAL WILL SINGLE OUT THE RADAR WARNING RECEIVER (RWR) AS A CANDIDATE SYSTEM. FISP, HOWEVER, HAS APPLICATION AND CAPABILITY WELL BEYOND THAT WHICH WILL BE PROPOSED AND COULD BE USED AS AN ONBOARD, CHIP-LEVEL, KNOWLEDGE-BASED SENSOR FUSION SYSTEM. FISP IS AN ALGORITHMIC APPROACH TO AN AI SYSTEM WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COMPUTER STORAGE AND EXECUTION SPACE NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SYSTEM OF THIS TYPE. WE BELIEVE FISP TO BE IDEAL AS A MEANS TO UPGRADE CURRENT SENSORS TO SMART, KNOWLEDGE-BSED SYSTEMS AND BELIEVE IT IS FULLY CAPABLE OF REPLACING THE HUMAN OPERATOR. THIS EFFORT WILL BE REFERRED TO AS AIRWR THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE PROPOSAL.
