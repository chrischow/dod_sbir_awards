Scalable and Temporal Data Analytics for Mobile ad
==================================================

# Abstract


Digital communications are vital to success on the modern battlefield. However, the abundance of networked resources, especially their ad hoc, dynamic character, introduces potential vulnerabilities including traffic overload and the formation of critical nodes. In order to manage these resources effectively, the warfighter must have appropriate analysis and visualization tools that can process large networks in real time. Because of the potential, extreme size of the networks this requires scalable computational solutions including multi-core processors, data parallel systems and/or GPUs. Kitware proposes to develop an open framework based on industry-standard informatics tools that have demonstrated capabilities to analyze and process large graphs such as those due to network analysis. The goal of the work is to incorporate a community of algorithms, common data structures and visualization in order to perform data mining, statistical analysis, and processing of dynamic, mobile ad hoc networks. Creating an architectural framework based on a proven quality software process will enable researchers, practitioners and commercial concerns contribute to, maintain and offer services to ensure the long-term viability of the project.
