ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR LOGISTICS PLANNING SYSTEMS
======================================================

# Abstract


THE FLUID SITUATIONS ENCOUNTERED ON THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD WILL DICTATE THAT PROVIDERS OF SUPPORT BE RESPONSIVE, FLEXIBLE AND DEMONSTRATE INITIATIVE. THE REALITIES OF OUR AUSTERE LOGISTICS STRUCTURE REQUIRE THAT THEY BE HIGHLY SYNCHRONIZED TO ORDER TO MEET ESSENTIAL NEEDS WITH AVAILABLE RESOURCES. TO MEET THE SUPPORT CHALLENGES THE NEXT BATTLE WILL PRESENT, THE ARMY NEEDS AN AUTOMATED, KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM WHICH WILL ALLOW LOGISTICS PLANNERS TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES, REGARDLESS OF ECHELON OR TYPE OF LOGISTICS ORGANIZATION, IN A CLASSIC "MORE-BETTER-FASTER" MANNER. THIS PHASE I EFFORT WILL DEFINE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A PETROLEUM SUPPLY DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (AS A SUBSET WITHIN THE LOGISTICS PLANNING FIELD) AND MODEL THAT DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM. THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL LOGISTICS PLANNING DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS AT ALL LEVELS AND WITHIN THE ARMY'S MAJOR FUNCTIONAL AREAS.
