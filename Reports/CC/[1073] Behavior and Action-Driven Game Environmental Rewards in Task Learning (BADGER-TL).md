Behavior and Action-Driven Game Environmental Rewards in Task Learning (BADGER-TL)
==================================================================================

# Abstract


SoarTech, an industry leader in the development of AI/ML-enabled agents that generate behavior in complex environments, proposes a proof of concept investigation into Behavior and Action-Driven Game Environmental Rewards in Task Learning (BADGER-TL.) The proposed approach fuses intelligent system design principals from goal-based cognitive models and supervised machine learning. BADGER-TL leverages SoarTechâ€™s over two decades of experience researching intelligent system design to produce an agent design that is capable of human-level reasoning and team coordination, even in novel situations, while remaining data efficient in its task learning and memory mechanisms. SoarTech will also investigate intuitive, human-centric interface designs that allow subject-matter experts to control and adjust intelligent agent behavior to produce desired effects and validate our design in an example wargaming environment domain.
