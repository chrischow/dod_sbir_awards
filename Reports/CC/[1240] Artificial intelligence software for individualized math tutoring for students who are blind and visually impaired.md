Artificial intelligence software for individualized math tutoring for students who are blind and visually impaired
==================================================================================================================

# Abstract


This Phase I proposal responds to Priority 2, Products, and focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence software for individualized tutoring of applied mathematics at the middle school level.  Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education.  The aim of this Phase I research is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired.  There is a considerable need for improved educational software for mathematic in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute.  A weak mathematics background also seriously hinders or even precludes effective pursuit of several other mathematically-intensive subjects such as the sciences.  Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with reading disabilities, using Internet-capable screen reader technology.  The potential technological innovation here is the development of the first advanced AI mathematics tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design.
