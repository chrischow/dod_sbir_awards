CASI Phase II: Cloud-based Analytics of Satellite Imagery
=========================================================

# Abstract


With the increasing availability of commercial satellite imagery; there is a need to develop a scalable and robust architecture to support software analytics that can exploit and deliver time critical information to our warfighters. Commercial sensor data can augment existing national assets in providing more coverage and advanced imaging capability that can be used to develop enhanced situational awareness. The proposed architecture must be able to support large-scale image processing and data analytics to enable monitoring, prediction and assessment of a specific area of interest. Satellite imagery of varying modalities and resolutions embeds both spatial and temporal information that must be managed and processed in such a manner that maintains its integrity and consistency. DZYNE Technologies proposes to continue to develop upon the success of the Cloud-based Analytics of Satellite Imagery (CASI) system to develop a unified data management system for commercial satellite imagery and an extensible service framework for deploying advanced analytics to support the warfighter in maintaining global situational awareness. The proposed effort will develop an end-to-end solution that supports (a) a scalable cloud-based data store; (b) an extensible framework for software analytics; and (c) an automated imagery and video tagging using Deep Learning algorithms for change detection
