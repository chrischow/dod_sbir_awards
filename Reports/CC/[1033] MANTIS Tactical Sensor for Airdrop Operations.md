MANTIS Tactical Sensor for Airdrop Operations
=============================================

# Abstract


The Multimode Airdrop Network Tactical Intelligence Sensor (MANTIS) combines multiple sensing technologies (acoustics, radio frequency (RF), electro-optics/infrared (EO/IR), environmental, etc.) into one sensor package that is integrated on airdrop payloads and personnel for high vantage intelligence gathering on enemy threat activity and overall battlefield situational awareness for follow-on warfighter actions. MANTIS combines proven, advanced SARA sensor technology in acoustic and RF signature detection, classification and location with low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf EO/IR and environmental sensors. MANTIS uses its combined sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to simplify the warfighter user interface, reduce the probability of false alarms, and enable reliable image classification. MANTIS is a networked multimode sensor node that communicates with other nodes and system users through the Nett Warrior soldier tactical network. Intelligence data is displayed as icons on a map in cursor-on-target format. MANTIS technology is applicable across multiple mission areas including forward operating base (FOB) protection, advanced hostile fire detection, and the increasingly critical counter hostile unmanned aerial system (UAS).
