ATOM- An AI Environment for New Microgravity Materials Development
==================================================================

# Abstract


G-Space is an AI environment that brings forward a new class of materials liberated from gravity. G-Space is strategically positioned at the intersection of terrestrial and space markets by seeking to understand material needs to meet the demands of the digital age in areas such as sensing, transmission, storage and energy efficiency while identifying new formulations that are stable and can only be manufactured in a reduced gravitational environment. There is a burgeoning economy interested in developing, promoting, and/or investing in efficient, profitable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials by using (a) a miniaturized version of the terrestrial process and (b) ineffective trial and error engineering to a material science problem.nbsp;G-Spacersquo;s main product is the Advanced Terrestrial to Orbital Manufacturing (ATOM) platform that builds on a terrestrial experimental technique, Gravity Elimination via Methods of Suspension (GEMS), enhanced through the addition of first-principles modeling, computational tools, and machine learning algorithms. G-Space is the only commercial company that provides a tool in advanced material manufacturing that harnesses the effect of gravity on material stability and narrows down the optimized 0G manufacturing envelope.nbsp;The main objective of this SBIR PhaseI is to develop a conceptual design of GEMS and to complete the buildout and beta testing of the ATOM platform, including a data manager, analysis and reporting system. The resulting platform will be validated using primarily in-house Heavy Metal Fluoride Glass data. In addition, the platform will be expanded to ingest selected material data from NASArsquo;s Microgravity Database as well as an additional suite of high profit margin materials with potential for fabrication in a zero G environment.
