Intuitive Data Analysis for Assessing Network Performance at Scale
==================================================================

# Abstract


Computer network operations deal with ever-increasing volumes of monitoring data in many different formats. Human operators require effective analytic tools to correlate and interpret this data to sustain optimal levels of uninterrupted network performance. This project delivers a practical solution for complex network traffic analysis founded on the concept of intelligent network operations. The key aspect of this solution is to equip network operators with an intuitive decision-making mechanism by means of linking and analyzing massive amounts of traffic information collected on a computer network. Phase I successfully proved the technical feasibility of the proposed solution. Phase I covered a product prototype, including: system engineering, data analytics, application development, and system deployment. Phase I delivered a beta release of an open-source network security monitor Dynamite-NSM with notable advanced capabilities. Phase I also produced the architecture foundation for the commercial solution. Overall, Phase I deliverables resulted in excellent building blocks for creating a mature open-source product as well as the commercial solution that could be introduced to customers during Phase II. Phase II will mature the open-source product for wide adoption by the community. Phase II will also release a commercial solution with the intent to acquire paying customers. The open-source product has been released as a standalone tool that can be freely used by the network operations community. Additionally, this product is being rolled into a commercial cloud solution as a service to network operations organizations.
