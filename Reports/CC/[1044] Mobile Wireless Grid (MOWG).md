Mobile Wireless Grid (MOWG)
===========================

# Abstract


Vigilant Cyber Systems, Inc. (VCS) proposes to develop the Mobile Wireless Grid (MOWG) as a platform for distributed computing and ad-hoc networking in the battlefield space with limited to non-existent network connectivity. MOWG provides a versatile framework to network multiple smartphones into a cohesive grid, partition complex data and compute problems across the available nodes, and combine results into a single cohesive solution. It thereby enables execution of complex clinical decision support, machine learning, and other algorithms that are too resource intensive to run on a single device in scenarios where it is not feasible to run such algorithms in the cloud. MOWG can work with an existing network of smartphones, or form an ad-hoc network as needed. It monitors the capabilities and constraints of the grid, including the number of devices and their hardware specifications, network speed and latency, other applications competing for device resources, and power constraints. Given these parameters, it dynamically assigns tasks to workers, optimizing both to maximize performance and minimize impact on the devicesâ€™ primary uses.
