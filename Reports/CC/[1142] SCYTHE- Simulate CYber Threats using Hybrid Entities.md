SCYTHE- Simulate CYber Threats using Hybrid Entities
====================================================

# Abstract


Recently, there has been at least one significant cyber security event in the world daily. Cyber threats, hackers, and criminals continue to develop advanced capabilities. A key finding of the 2014 DHS CyberSkills Task Force was a clear need for provide more training for cyber security employees. The US Federal Government needs to put a greater emphasis on ensuring its employees have the cyber understanding and tools to effectively and securely do their jobs. A training solution enabling cyber defenders to rehearse needed knowledge and skills in a realistic context would help build needed skills quickly. TiER1â€™s proposed SCYTHE (Simulate CYber Threats using Hybrid Entities) system will advance the state-of-the-art in cyber operator training technologies. SCYTHE combines proven technologies and gameful learning design with innovative advances in intelligent agent authoring capabilities. SCYTHE offers a live training sandbox where trainee cyber defenders interact with advanced attacker agents. In a sophisticated pedagogical design, trainee defenders will train and rehearse in a realistic operating environment with threats created by external and internal sources. The hybrid agents are enabled with cutting-edge machine learning from data to generate adaptive, realistic behavior in a way that supports the achievement of learning objectives.
