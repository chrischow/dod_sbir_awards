Innovative Position Navigation and Timing
=========================================

# Abstract


Third Insight has developed the next generation in artificial intelligence-based autonomous UAV navigation software. We have combined our patent-pending Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution with a specialized suite of sensors and a US-built micro-UAV to enable rapid, autonomous inspections of large aircraft during pre/post-flight inspections and phased maintenance. Over the full 18 months of this Phase II work effort, Third Insight proposes to build and test multiple autonomous drone solutions for USAF and commercial partners. Customer discovery, engineering development/testing, and ensuring DoD compliance for on-base operations will be key focus areas. Phase 2 milestones include flight tests with USAF maintainers at one or more Texas ANG bases in Texas. Letters of support are included from two-star general Dawn M. Ferrell (TXANG, Deputy Adjutant General â€“ Air), who gives Third Insight her highest possible recommendation and support to develop and test our drone solution with maintainers at three wings (F-16, C-130, and MQ-9) across Texas, and from our commercial partner, Flatirons Solutions, which provides technical information management to 8 of the 10 largest airlines in the world.
