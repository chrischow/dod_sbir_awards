Data-Parallel Analytics on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)
===========================================================

# Abstract


We are proposing to enable automated discovery of machine learning pipelines on graphs using our system of accelerated primitives. While our existing technology greatly reduces the need for users to understand super-computing, it still requires expertis...
