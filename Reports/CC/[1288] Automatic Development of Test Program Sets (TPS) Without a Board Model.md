Automatic Development of Test Program Sets (TPS) Without a Board Model
======================================================================

# Abstract


Innovative approaches to digital test program development hold promise of reducing development time and costs by significant amounts. The costs related to traditional digital test development are primarily due to simulation and modeling development plus the associated support costs of the tools and processes. A concept that can eliminate simulation and modeling and associated costs has been proposed and needs to be investigated. The concept has been partially extracted from other real world development tools that are thought to provide meaningful analogy and focus for portions of the envisioned process. Artificial Intelligence concepts are employed by the new vision and are central to its success. The ideal result of the proposed investigation is a solidified and well defined specification for a tool set and process that can totally eliminate the need for digital test development using simulation and modeling.
