Probabilistic Evidential Reasoning for Collecting Signals Intelligence Data
===========================================================================

# Abstract


Management Sciences, Inc. (MSI) develops cognitive artificial intelligence tools. Cognitive reasoning is a logically constructed mathematical process that mimics the way people quickly process data into an understanding of a situation. We propose to develop a cognitive framework and toolset for processing Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) data. The architecture will have a solidly theoretical foundation with a Turing Complete Bayesian Inference Calculus for fusing data into higher and higher distillations not just collecting it. The toolset will work by using evidential fusion in combination with frames of reference to pick out important features and patterns in a track and test them against hypotheses to identify the track develop an understanding of its meaning in the context of current operations. The toolset will be used to support the work of SIGINT operators as they evaluate tracks for patterns and trends in support of the detection, identification, and tracking of potential threats.
