Development of Autonomous Glycemic Control Mechanism for Patients Suffering Glycemic Abnormalities as a Result of Critical Illnesses
====================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The use of continuous glucose monitors can be an invaluable management tool for patients afflicted by glycemic variability due to critical illness or trauma. Maintaining stable glucose levels enhances health and lowers care costs, and individuals equipped with continuous glucose data have significantly improved outcomes. Profusa has developed highly miniaturized, injectable, tissue-like, glucose sensors that minimize the foreign body response, enabling long-term monitoring. Sensors are wirelessly, fluorescently read through the skin (continuously or on-demand) and data is transmitted to a smart phone for viewing and analysis. In this STTR, we aim to transition our successfully demonstrated glucose sensors into a biodegradable format and to apply artificial intelligence to optimize the signal accuracy. We will utilize degradable hydrogels already used in other FDA-approved degradable devices to adapt our sensors to dissolve harmlessly, leaving no lasting implant in the body after their useful life for trauma care. Furthermore, our system collects multi-parameter data streams (oxygen, temperature, etc.), and we will apply artificial intelligence approaches to optimize the measurement accuracy. By integrating a machine learning approach into the analysis, different characteristic signatures will be inherently trained into the signal interpretation to ultimately lead to better closed loop glycemic control.
