radGPU- Radiation Hardened GPU in a CubeSat
===========================================

# Abstract


Traditional CPUs are falling short to meet high performance real-time processing needs of modern sensor technology (imaging, video, signals intelligence are critical needs for satellite image analysis and sensor control). There is a growing need to deploy GPUs along with modern sensors in the LEO and MEO (inner Van Allen Belt) and survive the radiation effects for 2-5 years. IAIâ€™s solution will use COTS GPU (feasibility study) and plug-them along with a CubeSat in a radiation-hardened assembly, and use in-house machine learning/deep learning knowledge on satellite imaging. We will work with our partners Prof. C Keif COSMAIC and Alpha Research and Technology to demo and build the radiation-hardened prototype, carry out radiation testing, satellite design and launch. If successful, this will be critical to the growing performance needs of modern satellites and transform the DoD industry. Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9817 (23 Oct 18)
