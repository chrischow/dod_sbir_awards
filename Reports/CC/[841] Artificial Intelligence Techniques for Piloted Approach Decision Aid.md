# Abstract


The Landing Signal Officer (LSO) faces many challenges.  Although  his primary concern remains safety, he must maintain an extremely rapid  recovery rate.  This dictates small times between each landing, and pressure  to not wave-off unless absolutely necessary.  LSO's have little time to make the  wave-off decision, must wait until the last possible second, and often may not  have a good definition of what that last second is.  In such a high pressure,  high stakes, and highly time constrained environment, Cognitive Science  Engineering (CSE) is required to determine the critical decisions and the best  methods to support them.  In such a complex, time pressured domain, no one  technique or paradigm is adequate.  Stottler Henke Associates, Inc. (SHAI)  plans to utilize a variety of AI techniques.  In Phase I we will elicit the required  knowledge and criteria from expert LSOs using CSE techniques and  absolutely prove the feasibility of our concepts with the implementation and  evaluation of a prototype.  Our phase I team includes cognitive psychologists  with extensive experience in studying experts confronted with judgments and  decisions in situations marked by high stakes, time pressure, conflicting  requirements and rapidly changing situations; top-notch AI developers; and  an experienced LSO and LSO instructor, Frank Pfeiffer.
