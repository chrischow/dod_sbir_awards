Game Interface for the OneSAF Computer Generated Forces Simulation
==================================================================

# Abstract


Todayâ€™s contemporary operating environment is filled with potential adversaries that exhibit a variety of individual and coordinated behaviors.  Proper response to these behaviors has become a critical training requirement for Soldiers and a variety of commercial gaming technologies have been proposed to provide the requisite training environment.  Where gaming technologies can be used to create engaging experiences, they typically lack the realism needed to properly portray the COE without significant modifications.  Behaviors of non-player entities is a particularly acute problem as most gaming artificial intelligence is either limited or is targeted at making a game challenging and fun rather than realistic.   Investments made by the DoD in AI technologies has produced a far more accurate and representative repository of the types of behaviors needed to represent the COE.  Integrating these with gaming technologies has great potential to solve current training gaps.  Forterra proposes to directly integrate its distributed, multi-player game platform through the SORD interface with OneSAF to produce a highly scalable, persistent, distributed virtual training system suitable for training in the COE.  We propose a design in Phase I with a feasibility demonstration as an option, and a full integration in Phase II.
