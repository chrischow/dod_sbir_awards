Deployment Web-Based Interface Tool
===================================

# Abstract


This proposal describes the design of a web-based system for gathering, collecting, and disseminating lessons learned.  The proposed system will be built with a user-centered design approach which includes interviewing users to identify problems with the current system used by Army Medical Command and defining requirements for the new system.  In addition, our approach includes usability testing and iterative prototype design, to ensure an effective solution.  The new system will include web-based tools allowing users to easily and securely enter and access information.   A main feature of the proposed system is the use of a fully-automated machine-learning technique called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to facilitate information searches.  This technique allows users to find information that is related in meaning rather than keywords.   Our proposed approach is divided into a set of logical, progressive steps.  In Phase I we will analyze the existing system, gather user requirements, and identify the database architecture.  At the end of Phase I, a demonstration prototype will be delivered.  The Phase I Option will be used for further software development planning.  In Phase II, the system will be developed into a working prototype, usability tests will be performed, and a final prototype will be built.
