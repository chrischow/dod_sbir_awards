HPChain: Energy-Efficient Scalable Blockchains for HPC Systems
==============================================================

# Abstract


Statement of the problem: HPC cybersecurity needs to diversify for increasing academic and industrial usages, especially for decentralized and distributed throughputs between HPC implementations. Blockchains can provide increased cybersecurity for HPC activities by using alternative blockchain proofs different from the ones used by simple amateur networks, and with some modifications can provide suitable academic and industrial cybersecurity in an energy-efficient manner without major disruptions of larger system activities. We have invented a new type of blockchain proof that improves HPC securitization and energy efficiency, as well as developed a platform for managing several optimization algorithms using some limited machine learning. Our blockchain proof also facilitates large-scale processes typical of HPCs and their internal energy analysis, integrating multiple HPC service components ito support distributed and decentralized service-oriented blockchain and non-blockchain activities between HPCs to further remove requirements for HPC colocation and support cloud architectures. We will optimize and develop our blockchain proof, develop and benchmark our selection of optimization algorithms, and develop and benchmark our cybersecurity protocols for security escalation using a mixture of commercial facility data and scientific/academic data. Several types of security escalation tests will be performed in conjunction with several types of simulated attacks, and energy efficiencies and vulnerabilities will be evaluated posthumously. A draft blockchain cybersecurity framework will be created that identifies similarities with NIST and DoD cybersecurity frameworks, and where advancements or divergences may be more appropriate when dealing with HPCs and blockchains. We will target commercial/industrial HPCs, such as used at universities and national infrastructure facilities, as well as other HPC cybersecurity targets, such as power plants, telecenters, healthcare contractors, financial transaction systems, weather modeling services, and first responder networks as greater HPC usage, colocation, and decentralization/cloud services will continue in those high-volume industries, all of which will necessitate radically improved HPC interconnectivity and securitization.
