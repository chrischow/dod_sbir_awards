Intelligent Multirotor Autonomous Ground Relocatable Sensor (IMAGRS)
====================================================================

# Abstract


Intelligent Multirotor Autonomous Ground Relocatable Sensor (IMAGRS) is an innovative and highly capable small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) that enables unattended multi-spectral imaging and processing. IMAGRS integrates existing technologies into a micro, transforming multirotor platform which autonomously acts as a relocatable imaging sensor. Critical enabling technologies, such as dual-use components and composite materials, enable the platform to meet demanding flight characteristics and mission constraints. Its transformable design enables the system to be pre-packaged and deployed from mounted cylindrical containers. Attached to the platform is a payload consisting of multi-spectral imaging, onboard compute, communications and advanced autopilot. The autopilot integrates with a collection of flight sensors that enable advanced autonomous behaviors including takeoff, navigation, precision landing, obstacle avoidance, and automatic recharging. The advanced autopilot can also trigger and command the imaging sensor and gimbal to view specific regions of interest. Advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms enable object recognition and tracking. The small, transformable platform, imaging sensor payload, and advanced autopilot can work together to autonomously achieve modern, demanding Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission objectives.
