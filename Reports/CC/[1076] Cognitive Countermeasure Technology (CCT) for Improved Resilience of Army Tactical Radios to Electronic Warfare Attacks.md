Cognitive Countermeasure Technology (CCT) for Improved Resilience of Army Tactical Radios to Electronic Warfare Attacks
=======================================================================================================================

# Abstract


R-DEX Systems (R-DEX) proposes to work with its strategic partners to develop the Cognitive Countermeasure Technology (CCT), a novel system that will radically increase the resilience of Army tactical radios to Electronic Warfare (EW) attacks. CCT will leverage the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to: (1) autonomously recognize when military waveforms are experiencing an EW attack and (2) effectively adapt to counter the attack. Specifically, CCT will determine signal classifier susceptibility to EW attacks, identify weaknesses of the classifier, and implement strategies to strengthen the classifier. To further improve signal classification, CCT will also implement real-time algorithms to identify the threat, learn the threat, and choose strategies to adapt to the threat. CCT will achieve its objectives via an innovative, multi-pronged approach that couples standard AI susceptibility and strengthening techniques with innovative R-DEX proprietary networks that not only improve signal classification performance but also enable the identification of EW attacks. Furthermore, CCT will be designed from the ground up to be a flexible and modular platform for both wireless communications and radar. A key focus of this effort is rapid deployment for tactical needs.
