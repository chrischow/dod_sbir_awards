Battlefield Medical Situational Awareness Goggles (Human Computer Interface)
============================================================================

# Abstract


Under SBIR Phases for “Battlefield Medical Situational Awareness Goggles (Human Computer Interface)”, TAM developed a robust speech enabled TRL-6 system, allowing medics to capture casualty information for TCCC and DD1380 cards. Under this Sequential Phase II, TAM will extend the work completed on earlier phases in the following areas: 1. Advance capabilities of TAM’s application, to reach TRL 7-8. 2. Improvements to the underlying Deep Neural Network (DNN) speech technology for improved accuracy and performance 3. Assist medics with hands-free casualty care, supporting prolonged, real-time treatment: a. Speech-enabled access and control for remote patient sensors b. Simultaneously manage multiple patients c. Provide alerts, alarms, reminders 4. Develop a hands-free Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) dialogue system using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to access a knowledge-based system built on information contained in the Combat Medic Handbook a. Provide real-time access to external knowledge sources. TAM will work on this project with the BATDOK team at AFRL, ONR, and industry leaders such as Northrop Grumman, to ensure our enhanced voice enabled application works within DoD’s prolonged field care (PFC) and telemedicine initiatives to support wounded warfighters. The technology developed will be applicable to DoD and First Responders, as well as high-noise and off-network
