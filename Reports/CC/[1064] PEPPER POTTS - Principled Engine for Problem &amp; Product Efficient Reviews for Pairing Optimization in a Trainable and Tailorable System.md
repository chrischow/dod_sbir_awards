PEPPER POTTS: Principled Engine for Problem &amp; Product Efficient Reviews for Pairing Optimization in a Trainable and Tailorable System
=========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Rapid innovation gives the US Army a tactical advantage over its enemies. The Army has a vast network of technology and users. Information about technology inside and outside the organization is difficult to sort through, assess, connect to users, and acquire. The Army needs a system that identifies capability gaps and matches needs to technology, fast. Aptima will deliver PEPPER POTTS to facilitate the creation of disruptive technology. More than a search engine, PEPPER POTTS acts as a digital cognitive assistant to tell the user what they didn’t know they didn’t know. It leverages AI, machine learning, and language modeling to exploit the latent structure of data and find information that already exists but is undiscovered. PEPPER POTTS learns the needs of Army operators, finds related and applicable technology, and presents the most relevant technology available inside and outside the organization to Army innovators. PEPPER POTTS can assist in automatically generating requirements based on operators' workflow and artifacts; parse data, create intermediate artifacts, and exploit the latent structure of data to extract meaningful information; and present information in multiple modalities, whether by chat, alerts, or a more traditional search.
