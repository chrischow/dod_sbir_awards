Optimized Geospatial Tool for Ambient Soundscapes
=================================================

# Abstract


This proposal addresses the need to further develop a robust and validated soundscape modeling tool for accurate predictions of biological, geophysical, and anthropogenic activity in CONUS and OCONUS environments. The Phase II development of the geospatial and acoustic training databases will focus on strengthening the geospatial diversity of the data by employing purposeful data collection techniques that build upon the analysis tools and strategies developed in Phase I. Phase II machine learning modeling efforts will incorporate new numerical tools, better uncertainty quantification, physics-based models, and extensive validation. The soundscape model will be coupled with a GIS tool by leveraging the web-based map viewer prototype developed in Phase I and incorporating tools to investigate the graphical representation of the acoustic metrics at a specific point on an overall, time, and frequency basis. To guide future transition plan and business case development, “use cases” will be developed for consumers associated with the two primary markets identified in Phase I.
