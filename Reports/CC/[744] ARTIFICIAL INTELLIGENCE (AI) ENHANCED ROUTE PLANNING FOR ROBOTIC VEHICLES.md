ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) ENHANCED ROUTE PLANNING FOR ROBOTIC VEHICLES
=========================================================================

# Abstract


ROUTE PLANNING IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THE UTILIZATION OF ROBOTIC VEHICLES WHETHER COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS OR TELEOPERATED. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG RANGE ROUTE PLANNING FOR LAND VEHICLES BY TRANSVERSING CROSS COUNTRY PATHS CREATED BY BOTH A COMPUTER GENERATED DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING MODEL AND BY A MILITARY EXPERT. ADVANTAGES, IF ANY, OF THE EXPERT PLANNED ROUTE WILL BE ANALYZED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) RULES FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE COMPUTER ROUTE PLANNING MODEL. PROBLEMS COMMON TO BOTH ROUTES, SUCH AS OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE AND CHECKPOINT LOCATION, WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR FUTURE STUDY.
