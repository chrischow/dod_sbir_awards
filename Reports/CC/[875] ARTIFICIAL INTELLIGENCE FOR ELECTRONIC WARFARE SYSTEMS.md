ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS
======================================================

# Abstract


THE ARMY IS CURRENTLY DEVLOPING/PROCURING FULLY AUTOMATIC SELF PROTECTION ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS. SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS, LIKE THE ALQ-136 (SEMA) AND THE APR-39 (XE-2), HAVE FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE SOFTWARE REPROGRAMMABLE TO ALLOW THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE TO BE TAILORED FOR SPECIFIC MISSIONS. THE ORIGINAL MISSION PROGRAMMING, A COMPLEX SOPHISTICATED PROCESS WITH MANY INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS, IS PERFORMED BY THE DEVELOPING CONTRACTOR. IT IS ULTIMATELY THE USER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP MISSIONIZED PROGRAMS FOR THESE SYSTEMS. THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE DEVELOPING CONTRACTOR IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE USER. THE USER MUST BE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY PROGRAM MISSION CHANGES AND DEVELOP REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF HOW THESE CHANGES IMPACT TOTAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPUTER PROGRAM, CALLED AN EXPERT SYSTEM, CAN BE DEVELOPED THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE USER GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CHANGE THE MISSION PROGRAM, WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED RESULT, AND WHAT IMPACTS THE CHANGES WILL HAVE ON OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. IN THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY, MACAULAY-BROWN PROPOSES TO PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE ALQ-136 (SEMA) MISSIONIZATION PROCESS, DETERMINE WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BUILD AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO GUIDE THAT PROCESS, AND DESCRIBE SUCH AN EXPERT SYSTEM, INCLUDING INPUT REQUIREMENTS, OPERATING PROCEDURE, AND OUTPUT RESULTS. THE STUDY WILL ENABLE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SCOPE OF BUILDING SUCH AN EXPERT SYSTEM AND THE BENEFITS GAINED FROM IT.
