MIMO Robotic Radios Operating in Congested and Contested Spectra
================================================================

# Abstract


Silvus StreamCaster radios and mobile networked MIMO waveform have many of the Army’s desired capabilities for the robotic radio. The proposed SBIR program will address the untargeted capabilities and formulate a radio and waveform design fully meeting the needs of future Army robotic applications. Specifically, the targeted capabilities are: 1) a low SWaP mission scalable radio architecture to provide for a variety of mission capabilities, 2) adding spread spectrum modulation to the MN-MIMO waveform for enhanced robotic command and network control, 3) optimizing the joint application of TX beam forming and RX beam nulling for complex radio environments,4) adding remote radio disable (or “kill”) capability and further cyber security radio enhancements, and 5) using machine learning and a situational display for operator interference characterization and avoidance. This SBIR project will push mobile networking and radio technology to ensure robotic systems have the needed anti-jam and low probability of detection technology to operate against near-peer jamming and electronic warfare threats in likely future battlefields (e.g., littoral mega-cities).
