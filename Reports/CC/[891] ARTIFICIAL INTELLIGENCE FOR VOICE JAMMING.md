ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR VOICE JAMMING
=========================================

# Abstract


EVALUATION OF JAMMING EFFECTIVENESS IN DATA SIGNALS IS RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD AND IS GENERALLY REPEATABLE. THAT IS, A PARTICULAR JAMMING SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE THE SAME BIT ERROR RATE EACH TIME A TEST IS RUN WITH THE SAME TEST PARAMETERS. EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF JAMMING OF VOICE SIGNALS HOWEVER, IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND EVEN WITH THE SAME TEST SUBJECTS, RESULTS WILL FREQUENTLY DIFFER FROM TEST TO TEST WITH THE SAME TEST PARAMETERS. A NEWLY DEVELOPED METHOD OF CHARACTERIZING VOICE SIGNALS COUPLED WITH A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TITLED "FINITE INDUCTIVE SEQUENCE PROCESSING" (FISP) HAS THE CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING REPEATABLE TESTING OF JAMMER EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST VOICE SIGNALS. FISP IS A PROPRIETRAY SYSTEM JOINTLY OWNED BY THE ADS/CIS TEAM.
