Vocabulary Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (V-ISR)
================================================================

# Abstract


In this Vocabulary Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (V-ISR) effort, Modus Operandi proposes to address a high priority technology risk for DCGS-A, text-based data analytics, by developing natural language sensor bots.  The bots will be synchronized to patrol data feeds, extracting vocabulary, relating it to concepts of interest to Military Intelligence analysts, and making the knowledge available to other software components. The resulting automated natural language processing capabilities will support advancements in fusion and exploitation of raw data intelligence products that contain natural language text.  We believe that such a high degree of automation is essential to feasibly address the massive volume of data feeds without placing an undue burden on analysts.  The ‘seed’ ontology at the core of our innovation is the key to making autonomous Natural Language Processing (NLP) feasible and efficient.
