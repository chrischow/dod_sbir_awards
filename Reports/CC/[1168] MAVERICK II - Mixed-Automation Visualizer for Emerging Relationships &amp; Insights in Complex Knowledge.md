MAVERICK II: Mixed-Automation Visualizer for Emerging Relationships &amp; Insights in Complex Knowledge
=======================================================================================================

# Abstract


System-level simulations of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) generate extremely large quantities of highly multidimensional data, which analysts at the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) must explore and analyze to infer insights and relationships. Existing tools based on automated routine scripts are ill-equipped to handle the volume and complexity of these data, requiring piecemeal analysis and inefficient workarounds. To address this challenge, we propose to develop MAVERICK, a Mixed-Automation Visualizer for Emerging Relationships & Insights in Complex Knowledge. MAVERICK is an integrated visual analytics tool that provides rich, insight-driven, expanded exploration and analysis capabilities to MDA analysts, and relies on recent breakthrough algorithms for dimensionality reduction, interactive visualizations, and mixed-automation support, combined as an integrated and learning cognitive assistant. MAVERICK will dually leverage advances in visual data mining and machine learning for adaptable and adaptive automation support. Ultimately, MAVERICK will enable efficient and effective interaction with and exploration of large, multidimensional datasets, leading to faster, more complete, and more insightful analyses of BMDS simulation data.
