# Abstract


This proposal presents an innovation in Focus Area 23: ldquo;Digital Transformation for Aerospacerdquo;, in subarea ldquo;T11.04: Digital Assistants for Science and Engineeringrdquo;.We propose creating a set of related artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies that operates on collections of documents, and extracts the necessary information to assist in the creation of new similar documents as well as verify the compliance of the documents that were created. We propose to do so in a domain-independent way, not being limited to a particular domain and class of document.The innovation could be later used to create digital assistants that address many of the priority tasks already pointed out by NASA experts as being of top priority. For example, it could identify current or past work related to an idea; serve as a digital assistant that can highlight lessons learned, suggest reusable assets, highlight past solutions or suggest collaborators based on the content; or serve as a base for a digital assistant that can create one or more component or system designs from a concept of operations, a set of high-level requirements, or a performance specification.
