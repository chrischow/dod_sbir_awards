Adaptive Artificial Intelligence for Next-Generation Conflict Simulation
========================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is for the design and development of a challenging, adaptable, and extendible AI system for use in state-of-the-art computer-based wargames.  The development will result in a 3rd generation computer wargame based on modern air power conflict and the ability to apply the technology developed for this project in other wargames ranging from tactical ground-based warfare to naval conflict and others.  The approach will use state-of-the-art AI technologies programmed into AI components which through well-defined interfaces will allow for a plug-and-play AI system.  This will provide for unlimited future development and enhancement.
