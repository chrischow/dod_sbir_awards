Alternate GPS Anti-Jam Technology
=================================

# Abstract


Current state-of-the-art GPS anti-jam technology relies heavily on multi-element antenna arrays and a processing unit that performs a phase-destructive sum of any intentional and unintentional interference signals in the GPS band. These systems are very effective â€“ but tend to be costly, large, and require high power. Canyon Systems is developing an alternate GPS anti-jam/anti-spoof solution to deliver robust jamming & spoofing suppression for systems requiring small size, weight and power, and cost (SWaP-C). Our anti-jam approach leverages recent advances in machine learning in the radio frequency (RF) domain to exploit the complex nature of real-world interference. Machine learning supports anti-spoof by analyzing the received waveform and classifying the observed features. Our unique technology will work with both single-element and dual-element antennas, initially as an external applique, with the potential for full integration in a military or commercial GPS or GNSS receiver. Our phase II Prototype will be based on COTS hardware and agile software development. GPS Anti-Jam Mitigation Engine (GAME) will be designed with technology that is non-linear and adaptive; its final form will be based on experimentation with integrated anti-jam suppression and deep learning applied to real world jamming waveforms.
