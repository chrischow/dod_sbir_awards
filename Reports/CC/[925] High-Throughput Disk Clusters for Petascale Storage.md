High-Throughput Disk Clusters for Petascale Storage
===================================================

# Abstract


The data management and storage functions for high performance computing face significant challenges, as todayâs solutions cannot provide sufficiently high-performance storage in a cost-effective, scalable manner.  This project addresses this problem with a scalable next-generation clustered storage platform based on 10-Gigabit Ethernet, with hardware-accelerated offload technology that bypasses typical software bottlenecks.  A hybrid architecture will combine cost-effective commodity components and technologies with custom hardware, in order to produce a scalable storage system that is capable of providing petabyte capacity with terabit connectivity.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The system should be especially well suited for sustained file transfers, visualization, data analytics, and other large-scale applications on dedicated ultra-high-speed networks such as the UltraScience Net
