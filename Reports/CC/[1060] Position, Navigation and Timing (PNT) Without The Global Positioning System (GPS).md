Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Without The Global Positioning System (GPS)
=================================================================================

# Abstract


The growing reliance on GPS for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities is a vulnerability as GPS can be readily compromised. We propose an artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) driven toolkit - a system of systems of interoperable components and methods that can be seamlessly used as necessary and appropriate for the tactical requirement and area in question. This suite includes: a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) for some variants; zero-velocity IMU updates; GPS receivers; pseudolite base stations with radio ranging capability; precision pressure and/or radar altimeter; cell tower ranging; and LoRa beacons and receivers, and mesh network radio-ranging, with all mobile and stationary nodes connected in a network to aid in PNT for all network nodes. Phase 1 would be an investigation and analysis of the error models for the proposed system components. This includes a literature search of applicable ranging methods for cell towers, and pseudolites/radio beacons to add to the error model library for the proposed systems. We will also investigate the use of PRN codes as a technique for ranging from pseudolites/radio beacons.
