ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS FOR EHF SATCOM MANAGEMENT
=======================================================

# Abstract


EHF SATCOM is designed to provide centralized planning with distributive execution. Communications planning includes the process of CINC and Component Commands generating network requirements and requests to the central planner. The central planner is responsible for developing an appotionment of EHF service resources, which is approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for each CINC which in turn can suballocate those resources to the Component Command or allocate them to specific EHF services . The Component Commands must develop specific resource utilization plans and distribute these to the fielded EHF terminals. Implementation of the EHF services is accomplished by the terminal operators and ensuing management of the services and resource utilization is required. Due to the complexity of the EHF SATCOM systems the planners, implementers and managers require software support tools. These software tools should contain artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to perform integration of a wide variety of input data and provide optimum planning, implementation and management decisions. AI tools or algorithms can be developed to integrate information of associated, but not necessarily directly related topics to ensure that the planning, implementation and management aspects of EHF SATCOM do not violate resource allocations and provide optimized coverage, performance, network configuration and resource utilization.
