# Abstract


THIS PROPOSAL PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A RAPID DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY FOR TACTICAL COMBAT MODELS. THE CAPABILITY IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT SAMPLING OF ALTERNATIVE SIMULATED TACTICAL DEPLOYMENTS (STDS), WHICH IS PRESENTLY NOT FEASIBLE TO DO ON A SCALE AND LEVEL OF DETAIL REQUIRED BY EXISTING LARGE-SCALE (THEATER LEVEL OR CORPS LEVEL) TACTICAL COMBAT MODELS. WITHOUT THIS CAPABILITY, THE METHODOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF USING PRESENT-DAY TACTICAL COMBAT MODELS AS A BASIS FOR TEST AND EVALUATION OF WEAPON SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT CENTERS ON THE USE OF A SINGLE STD, AND IS EXTREMELY WEAK. THE AVAILABILITY OF A RAPID DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY WILL ENABLE THE USE OF SAMPLES OF STDS IN TEST AND EVALUATION, AND WILL RADICALLY BROADEN THE SCOPE OF INFERENCE OF TACTICAL-COMBATMODEL-BASED ANALYSES, AND JUSTIFY THEIR USE AS A BASIS FOR EVALUATION OF THE COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS OF MILITARY SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT.
