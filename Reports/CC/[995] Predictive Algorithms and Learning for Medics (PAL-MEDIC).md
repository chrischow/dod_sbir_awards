Predictive Algorithms and Learning for Medics (PAL-MEDIC).
==========================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is for Predictive Algorithms and Learning for Medics (PAL-MEDIC).PAL-MEDIC is an integrated mobile application that will provide critical support to Army combat medics and civilian paramedics during pre-hospital patient care and will also enhance the subsequent care process. Our goal in the PAL-MEDIC project is to: Improve the ability of Army combat medics and civilian paramedics to save a patients life during pre-hospital care, including at the point of injury and during the in-transit and hand-off processes; Apply advanced AI-based machine learning algorithms in combination with available procedural and medical databases to provide medics with instantaneous medical alerts, predictions of patient condition, applicable care guidelines and recommended medical courses of action; Develop PAL-MEDIC as a product that runs on the US Army PEO Soldier NETT Warrior Android/End User Device for rapid transition to Army programs, and as well as a viable product for commercial sales in the wider military and civilian emergency care markets, Demonstrate a comprehensive approach that will immediately advance the state-of-the-art in emergency medical support and also provide a framework for future integration into a Medical Common Operating Picture (MCOP) as well as for future advances in predictive medical algorithms.
