Adaptive Artificial Intelligence for Next-Generation Conflict Simulation
========================================================================

# Abstract


The development of adaptive AI technology is vital to the creation of simulation technology with predictive capabilities. The objective of this research project is to deliver an adaptive AI-based simulation technology with predictive capabilities that will enable a family of operational-level tools and simulations that can propose and assess realistic and emergent adversarial behavior, automate the creation and examination of potential friendly and adversary courses of action (COAs), help reduce the risks of cascading effects, and support planners in anticipating, planning for, and combating threats using the full range of new conflict-winning capabilities including advanced weapons systems (AWS) such as directed energy weapons (DEW).    The effort will involve the RI partner, JPL/NASA/Caltech conducting a series of verification and validation (V&V) tests of the Cyberwar XXI adaptive AI technology (implemented during Phase I in a playable Iraq War simulation scenario), with Hexagon conducting additional research and development based on feedback and data from each of the V&V rounds resulting in a higher confidence AI technology and a more accurate simulation of the Iraq War.
