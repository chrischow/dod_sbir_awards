MEMES: Machine Learning for Mission Environment Support
=======================================================

# Abstract


We propose MEMES (Machine Learning for Mission Environment Support) to assess applicability of machine learning (ML) algorithms for mission command tasks and tailor ML algorithms to operational needs. Mission tasks (such as resource allocation, threat identification, and waypoint determination) are complex in terms of data (such as RF, cyber, mobility, video, and image) and decision-making process (such as classification, detection and prediction). MEMES will analyze a wide range of machine learning algorithms for mission command tasks. assess mission command tasks in terms of their technical objective, response time criticality, target accuracy, types of data, and then identify appropriate ML algorithms for their implementation. MEMES will also develop models to estimate cost, benefit, and risk of using machine learning solutions for mission tasks to assess the feasibility.
