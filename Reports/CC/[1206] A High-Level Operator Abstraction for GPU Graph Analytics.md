A High-Level Operator Abstraction for GPU Graph Analytics
=========================================================

# Abstract


We are proposing a new software framework for analyzing very large graphs using massively parallel processors (GPUs).  This framework will be commercialized on a cloud platform that gives users immediate access to highly advanced big-data analytics through a user-friendly web interface, as well as an HTTP API for easy integration. The platform can be deployed on a private cloud if desired.  The system we propose will greatly lower the technological, time and cost barriers to massive graph analysis and will enable a new generation of applications and research in the field.
