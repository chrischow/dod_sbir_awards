# Abstract


THIS ACTIVITY ADDRESSES USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SEARCH TECHNIQUES TO AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINE A MISSION PATH FOR A TANK COMMANDER.THE PLANNING IS BASED ON EITHER A STANDARD TOPOGRAPHIC MAP OR ON A DIGITAL DATA BASE. ONCE THE PATH IS GENERATED, PERSPECTIVE VIEW GRAPHICS ARE USED TO PERMIT THE COMMANDER TO CORRELATE THE TOP-DOWN MAP AND ROUTE INFORMATION WITH THE ACTUAL SCENE AS SEEN FROM THE TANK DRIVER'S PERSPECTIVE. AN EXPERT SYSTEM IS USED TO PROVIDE ADVISORY INFORMATION, AND AN EFFICIENT INTERFACE IS PROVIDED TO PERMIT APPROPRIATE ALTERATIONS TO THE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED PATH.
