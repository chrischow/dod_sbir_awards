Agile Electronic Support
========================

# Abstract


Vadum will design and develop an Agile Electronic Support (AES) system that identifies and characterizes RF signals in crowded spectrum. AES improves Army EW effectiveness and survivability by delivering spectrum Situational Awareness (SA) including indication of enemy forces through their use of RF communications and radar systems. The AES software component integrates advanced machine learning, signal processing and resource allocation algorithms into a generalized electronic warfare receiver according to Modular, Open Systems Approach (MOSA) design principles. Vadumâ€™s innovative RF signal processing and resource allocation protocol addresses specific challenges that inhibit many deep learning modulation recognition algorithms from performing well in crowded spectrum through efficient dynamic RF scanning, sub-band processing and spatial filtering. Computationally-efficient algorithms developed during the program and embedded on the candidate SDR systems will enable generalized software design. The AES software is designed for portability across a wide range of Army systems, and accounts for variations in platform size, weight, and power requirements. AES supports a range of operations from software applications executed on a laptop (e.g. EWPMT) to small form factor organic payloads operating on SWAP constrained UGV/UAV platforms.
