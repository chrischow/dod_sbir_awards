# Abstract


THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS AN APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTALREFINEMENT OF TECHNIQUES AND INTERFACE COMPONENTS TO FACILITATE USER ACCESS TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION DATA IN THE CONTEXT OF MILITARY DECISION PROBLEMS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR DECISION AIDING INTERFACES FOR TIME-STRESSED, MILITARY DECISIONS THAT BEGIN WITH A CHARACTERIZATION OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND ASSOCIATED TYPES OF UNCERTAINTY, THEN SURVEYS PERTINENT INFORMATION PROCESSING AND DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES, AND THEN USES THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST TWO STEPS TO GUIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE DECISION MAKER'S INFORMATION NEEDS. THUS, WE WILL CONSTRUCT A DESIGN PROCESS THAT FORCE ANALYTIC DISCRIMINATION ONLY TO THE EXTEND REQUIRED TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC DESIGN DECISIONS. TIME CONSTRAINTS AND TEMPORAL PROCESSING CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPUTERS AND HUMAN DECISION MAKERS WILL BE ADDRESSED S INTEGRAL ELEMENTS OF THE SITUATION. AIDING TECHNIQUES WILL BE RATED ACCORDING TO THE PROCESSING TIMES AND USAGE TIMES IMPOSED ON THE DECISION MAKER SO THAT ALTERNATIVES FOR THE SAME APPLICATION CAN BE EXAMINED WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING CONSTRAINTS OF THE SITUATION.
