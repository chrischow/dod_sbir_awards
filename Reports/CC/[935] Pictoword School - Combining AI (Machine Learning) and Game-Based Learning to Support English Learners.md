Pictoword School: Combining AI (Machine Learning) and Game-Based Learning to Support English Learners
=====================================================================================================

# Abstract


KooApps previously developed Pictoword, an application that uses visual, puzzle, and game-based mechanics for players to build fun vocabulary words by combining pictures. In this Phase I project, the team will develop a new prototype intended to personalize the learning experience for individual students who are English learners (ELs) to build their English vocabulary. The prototype will include an artificial intelligence engine, enhanced educational content, and a teacher dashboard to track student performance. At the end of Phase I, in a research study with 100 grade 3 EL students, researchers will determine whether the prototype functions as intended to personalize the learning experience, whether students are engaged with the app, whether teachers believe that the full concept can be integrated into instructional practice, and whether the app shows promise of improving outcomes for improving vocabulary.
