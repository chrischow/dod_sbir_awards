Provably Unclonable Functions on Re-configurable Devices
========================================================

# Abstract


Physically uncloneable functions (PUFs) have the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity by forming the basis for next-generation secure networks and trusted computing environments. During Phase I, Potomac Research and OSU evaluated of three physically uncloneable function (PUF) designs that can be implemented on COTS FPGAs. One design based on hybrid Boolean networks (HBN-PUFs) emerged as the clearly superior design, and it provides state-of-the-art uniqueness and robustness, with vastly higher entropy, compared existing digital electronic and emerging nano-technology designs. The HBN-PUF has unique properties that we believe make it significantly less vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks that many other PUF designs have succumbed to, as well as enabling novel use cases in tamper-proofing and trusted computing. The proposed Phase II project is to more fully develop the theory of HBN-PUF operation, evaluate its ML-resistance, perform preliminary experiments on novel applications for supply chain security, evaluate its robustness to temperature and voltage variations, and to package it for commercialization.
