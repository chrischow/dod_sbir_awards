Cognitive Heterogeneous Adaptive Operational System (CHAOS)
===========================================================

# Abstract


Objective. TCI seeks to develop and produce an innovative and unique communications Digital Chaos solution platform (brand-named NvisiLink) providing superlative resilience to interference and electronic attack . The NvisiLink platform is a low-power, featureless communication waveform that affords low probability of detection and intercept, in an expeditionary, lightweight and ruggedized form factor suitable for immediate and simplified support of and integration with a wide range of legacy communications systems – including commercial smart phones and similar COTS devices - employed by tactical small teams in military, public safety and law enforcement communities, and in various commercial applications. The innovative and unique design elements of the system, including MIMO/Diversity antenna designs, DSA capability, machine-learning for jammer classification/mitigation and a parasitic mode of operation that permits covert communications below the “noise floor” of commercial WiFi and LTE networks, as well as affording resistance to interference and jamming.
