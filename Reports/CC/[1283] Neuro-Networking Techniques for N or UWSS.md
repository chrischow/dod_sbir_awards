Neuro-Networking Techniques for N/UWSS
======================================

# Abstract


The NORAD/USSSPACECOM Warfighting Support System (N/UWSS) aims to provide a highly responsive and cost-effective "sensor-to-decision-maker-to-shooter" capability, encompassing all of the known Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) deficiencies. An intelligent data filtering tool will provide improved data access, integration, storage and control for space-based sensors across C2 systems. The tool will test a variety of algorithms for their effectiveness and efficiency in tuning filters and reducing network traffic across sensors. The algorithms tested will include neural networks, genetic algorithms, and clustering algorithms such as K-means and Kohonen's Self Organizing Map. The search tool will be based on RAM Laboratories' WarpIV kernel, which will link our search tool with real-time databases via the communications infrastructure, and run efficiently via parallel and distributed processing. Specifically, this Phase I effort will (1) demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an intelligent data filtering tool for space-based sensors, (2) research and develop a variety of artificial intelligence algorithms to conduct filtering, and (3) develop a physical proof-of-concept prototype that will improve data access, integration, storage and control for space based-sensors across C2 systems.
