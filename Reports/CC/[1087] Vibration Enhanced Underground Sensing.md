Vibration Enhanced Underground Sensing
======================================

# Abstract


Vadum and North Carolina State University (NCSU) will develop a Vibration-ENhanced Underground Sensing (VENUS) system that delivers improved target discrimination and classification with reduced False Alarm Rate (FAR) for shallow buried (up to 6) low-metal-content (LMC) landmine detection. This technology excites mechanical vibrations in landmines and uses robust, high-resolution digital signal processing algorithms to detect landmines and advanced machine learning techniques to provide high discriminative performance.
