Advanced Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and AI/ML Algorithm Study
=====================================================================

# Abstract


Technology Service Corporation (TSC) proposes to identify Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) scenarios of interest, and assess a wide variety of advanced state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for post-intercept and other forms of debris, clutter, and electronic attack/electronic protection (EA/EP) applications in missile defense radars. The study will further consider baseline and advanced radio frequency (RF) signal processing techniques. Approved for Public Release | 19-MDA-10270 (18 Nov 19)
