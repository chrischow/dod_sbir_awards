Intelligent Medical Crew Assistant (IMCA)
=========================================

# Abstract


Our proposed concept is the Intelligent Medical Crew Assistant (IMCA), which is an intuitive, adaptive, voice-interactive intelligent user interface that functions as a virtual medical officer to enable enhanced crew medical autonomy.nbsp; By developing this important front-end technology, IMCA promises to seamlessly integrate these tools and resources to support longitudinal crew monitoring, health maintenance, medical care and emergency response as well as optimization of resources for long-duration human spaceflight. IMCA, utilizes an integrated set of technological brick components aimed at providing support to the crew with respect to medical operations. The first component is a Dialog based/Voice enabled intelligent assistant with Natural Language Processing and intents identification. Crew can ask any question with respect to the medical procedures, inventory of medical supplies, their health monitoring, and recommended counter measures. The second technology brick is an AR enabled Electronic Procedures platform containing a repository of the medical procedures, an execution engine, an Augmented Reality device and software to guide the crew during the procedure execution. This component is able to provide Just-in-Time Training (JITT) for medical procedures using AR or/and VR glasses. A third brick is an Adaptive User Interface, adapting training or procedure execution to the level of expertise and cognitive workload of the crew. Our IMCA integrates with the EHR/EMR and medical inventory system in to monitor the health of the astronauts and help them identify resources needed for medical procedures. Machine Learning algorithms provide indications adverse medical conditions using individual crew health monitoring data. By having the data and procedural guidance when they need it, in a format optimized to each respective crewmembers skills and UI/UX preferences, crew will be able to more effectively operate autonomously and achieve both health hand mission goals.
