# Abstract


The Intelligent Maintenance Analysis System (IMAS) enables correct assessment of aircraft specific maintenance event context.Different environment, mission and operational contexts drive different cost metrics.The IMAS solution improves cost estimates as it overcomes the present limitations associated with making simplifying assumptions with regard to failure and reliability functions in common practice.Combining this technology with a CBM+ implementation facilitates more effective opportunistic maintenance decisions and condition based scheduling thereby improving ability to avoid cost of non-required maintenance.IMAS learns human expertise and reapplies their knowledge by utilizing advanced machine learning technologies to memorize all available data and later recall patterns that indicate a degraded platform.The capabilities resulting from this project can significantly contribute to increased platform availability and improved future mission capability rates.By using this technology to indicate when inspections and maintenance actions are actually warranted (enabling a CBM+ implementation) instead of by scheduled periodic inspections; aircraft reliability will be increased.Cost savings are realized via timely resolution to problem reports.Many companies provide CBM+ analytics capabilities; however many fielded systems have limited scalability and this increases overall costs.IMAS will be scalable as it is a derivation of a NYC high frequency trading prediction analysis system.
