Video Analysis Using Perceptual Organization and Machine Learning
=================================================================

# Abstract


The objectives of this project (Phase I and II) are to develop learning type algorithms for the purpose of automated identification and tracking of events captured on video. Phase I will develop learning based algorithms for use with identifying events in digital video.  Phase II will develop and demonstrate prototype software capable of automated video data analysis using an algorithm that learns what key events look like and then is able to find those events in a video stream. This will be based on a Perceptual Organization framework for motion estimation and to extract relevant features from a video stream and a Machine Learning framework for learning and event identification.
