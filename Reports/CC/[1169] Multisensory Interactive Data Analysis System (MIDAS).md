Multisensory Interactive Data Analysis System (MIDAS)
=====================================================

# Abstract


The Multisensory Interactive Data Analysis System (MIDAS) is a revolutionary interactive and iterative system for data visualization, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis testing. It provides visualizations and sonifications of datasets under investigation to allow the user to explore relationships between parameters in the dataset and between data sets. MIDAS leverages the vast capabilities of the human perceptual system, the world's most advanced pattern-detection system. While recent advances in machine-learning have made great progress, no system is yet as powerful at detecting subtle, time-varying patterns. The Government amasses extremely large quantities of test, simulation and operational data. From these data sets, analysts must identify trends, discontinuities, and unexpected correlations, and then develop an understanding of discovered relationships. MIDAS is a tool that permit analysis to immersively explore large data sets and rapidly uncover correlations and relationships that would largely go unnoticed using conventional techniques.
