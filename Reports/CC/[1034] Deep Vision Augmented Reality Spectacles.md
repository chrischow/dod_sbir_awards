Deep Vision Augmented Reality Spectacles
========================================

# Abstract


To address the Army’s need for a next-generation protective eyewear platform that augments natural vision, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISI) proposes to develop a new Deep Vision Augmented RealiTy Spectacles (DARTS) system utilizing deep learning-based algorithms for enhancing vision and using wide field-of-view ballistic protection optics, multimodal sensor fusion, and soldier system integration including end-user device and soldier power managers. Specifically, the innovative vision enhancement system provides wide field-of-view, high-resolution see-through overlay capability, enabling low-latency augmented reality as well as artificial intelligence performance. The algorithms will be implemented onto a ballistic protection eyewear with unobstructed see-through augmented-reality optics coupled with built-in sensing components. As a result, this system offers vision enhancement with ballistic protection, unobstructed natural vision, and improved lethality and situational awareness, which directly address the Army PEO Soldier’s requirements. In Phase I, ISI will demonstrate the feasibility of DARTS by performing a tradeoff analysis and developing a conceptual design for integrating vision enhancement into a protective eyewear platform. This will be followed by a representative breadboard prototype to demonstrate DARTS feasibility. In Phase II, ISI plans to generate a detailed technical design and address engineering challenges with the technology by building and testing a wearable prototype for user acceptance.
