Virtual Arena for Designing and Analyzing Prototypes of Technology and Tactics (V-ADAPT)
========================================================================================

# Abstract


Early Synthetic Prototyping seeks to streamline the design and procurement process of new equipment and vehicles by allowing scientists, engineers, and warfighter end users to design and verify equipment concepts in a virtual environment. A serious challenge to this goal is determining how to leverage data generated in virtual battlespace scenarios to determine the effectiveness of concept equipment. DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) proposes to meet this challenge by developing the Virtual Arena for Designing and Analyzing Prototypes of Technology and Tactics (V-ADAPT) system. V-ADAPT is built around powerful machine learning algorithms that exploit the vast amount of data collected within the virtual battlespace; it autonomously learns the complex dynamics of individual and group behaviors in the context of the equipment and vehicle configurations used by soldiers in the game. This allows soldiers, scientists, and engineers to rapidly understand the effectiveness of proposed gear and vehicles early in the acquisition process. V-ADAPT also uses machine learning techniques to rank and visualize interrelationships buried within the data. These visualization tools allow analysts and engineers to intuitively explore the complex relationships in the data and to rapidly build an understanding of the dependencies among soldier behaviors, equipment load-outs, battlespace terrain, and adversary tactics.
