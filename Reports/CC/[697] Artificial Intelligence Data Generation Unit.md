Artificial Intelligence Data Generation Unit
============================================

# Abstract


Integrated Software, Inc. and SAIC propose a Phase I project to determine the system characteristics and demonstrate the feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence Data Generation Unit (AIDGU). The AIDGU will employ artificial intelligence techniques to generate scenarios and data for engagement training systems. The AIDGU will automate training scenario generation, facilitate scenario modification and present an easily used interface to instructors. The AIDGU will be designed to interface with currently deployed engagement training aids. The proposed project (Phase I and Phase II) will result in a detailed task analysis of the automatic data generation process, a requirements specification for an AIDGU and a system to demonstrate the feasibility of building such a system. The Phase I effort will research,and analyze the current data generation process. It will evaluate, quantify and describe current and emerging hardware and software technologies with which to implement the AIDGU. The Phase I effort will also define an AIDGU product to be prototyped in Phase II. Phase I objectives will be accomplished in four tasks: 1) Research data generation requirements; 2) Derive AIDGU system level requirements; 3) Research and analyze alternative technologies and 4) define alternative approaches and designs, and produce the final report.
