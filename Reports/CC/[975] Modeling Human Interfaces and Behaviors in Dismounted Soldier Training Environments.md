Modeling Human Interfaces and Behaviors in Dismounted Soldier Training Environments
===================================================================================

# Abstract


RNI with team member Technical Solutions, Inc. (TSI/TERI) is proposing a unique integrated solution to this problem.  An innovative effort to design, develop and demonstrate Multi-Modal Interfaces for Synthetic Training Environments for effective training.  The system will allow live humans as team or squad leaders to utilize a suite of interface devices to control and interact with automated forces and the simulation environment.   It is well known that small teams of dismounts often use non-verbal communications to direct subordinates.  These “gestures” may also be repeated to by sub-commanders to other team members.  Similarly, non-verbal responses may be used providing full 2-way communication of key tactical methods and status within the team.  Current semi-automated force (SAF) applications do not include non-verbal communication capabilities and often have limited or poor world response and interaction capabilities.   World interaction includes any number of items such as the ability to “use” a light switch or recognize potential danger indicated by an opened door or broken window. The proposed concept addresses the limitations of current systems artificial intelligence (AI) and input devices available for humans-in-the-loop.  The concept also allows full functionality in software without requiring use of specialized equipment.
