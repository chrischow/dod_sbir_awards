Deep Vision Augmented Reality Spectacles
========================================

# Abstract


To address the Armyâ€™s need for a next-generation protective eyewear platform that augments natural vision, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISI) proposes, in Phase II, to advance the new Deep Vision Augmented RealiTy Spectacles (DARTS) system proven feasible in Phase I. DARTS utilizes deep learning-based algorithms for enhancing vision and using ballistic protection lenses, and soldier system integration, including end-user device and soldier power managers. Specifically, the innovative vision enhancement system provides wide field-of-view, high-resolution see-through overlay capability, enabling low-latency augmented reality as well as artificial intelligence (AI)-based vision enhancing markup to aid in visual detection, identification, and acquisition of targets. The algorithms will be implemented onto ballistic protection eyewear with unobstructed see-through augmented-reality optics coupled with built-in sensing components. As a result, the DARTS system offers vision enhancement with ballistic protection, unobstructed natural vision, and improved lethality and situational awareness, which directly address the Army requirements. In Phase II, ISI plans to refine the DARTS design and integrate DARTS hardware and optics into ballistic compliant spectacles for practical use in relevant military environments. ISI will produce 12 DARTS prototypes, which will be tested for key performance characteristics, including ballistic compliance, user acceptance, and enhancement of vision and lethality.
