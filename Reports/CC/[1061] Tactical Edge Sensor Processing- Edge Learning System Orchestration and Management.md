Tactical Edge Sensor Processing- Edge Learning System Orchestration and Management
==================================================================================

# Abstract


Intelesense Technologies (rebranding as IoT/AI), in partnership with Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), proposes to demonstrate an Edge Learning System Orchestration and Management system. The system is distributed and hierarchical adaptation and learning system design through emulations and simulation based on IoT/AI’s work in distributed intelligence “edge as a service” systems that aggregates sensor data, executes machine learning nearest the sensor, maintains a self-healing mesh network across low latency/low bandwidth conditions, and incorporates power modulating and adjusting edge compute. IoT/AI has the multi-stack expertise of radio, networking, sensors, data, AI/ML, and intelligent distributed mesh routing that will ensure a successful Phase 1 for the Army.
