Retrofit Enhancement for Color Night Vision
===========================================

# Abstract


To address the U.S. Army’s need for a technical refresh on the legacy Star SAFIRE IIIs for higher resolution and longer standoff detection distance with color night vision capability that increase soldier lethality, Intellisense Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a new ground-based Retrofit Enhancement for Color Night Vision (RECON) system, leveraging a SBIR Phase II development for USSOCOM. Specifically, the innovation in integration of a compact color night vision camera system with uniquely designed optics, along with a packaging that is rugged, allows the RECON imaging system to achieve the required range and resolution for positive identification of targets in nighttime conditions, hence increasing soldier lethality in support of integrated base defense and force protection. As a result, this new development effort will enable Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) the flexibility to retrofit and enhance the obsolete systems and re-introduce them into theater as an enhanced warfighting capability at a reduced life cycle cost of developing a brand-new system thereby ensuring that every Army dollar spent builds lethality across the force. In addition, this effort will also enable the U.S. Army to accommodate other technical refreshes, including insertion of advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence algorithms for automatic target detection to truly enable new “capabilities in the white space.” After fully developing the RECON system, Intellisense will transition the technology to the U.S. Army.
