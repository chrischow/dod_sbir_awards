Advanced Algorithms for Prediction, Display, and Visualization of Moving Targets
================================================================================

# Abstract


Applied Visions, Inc.(AVI) proposes to leverage  the technology of computer games to provide a powerful new method of predicting and visualizing the potential movement of time critical moving targets for operators of the FCS and FFW networked effects nodes. Our research will build upon the results of a similar SBIR project sponsored by the Navy for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). That effort, currently entering Phase II, uses agent-based artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the likely destinations and paths of the targets, combined with sophisticated vehicle mobility modeling to calculate the probable locations of the vehicle at any given future time as they move towards those destinations. Our Phase I effort will be devoted to analyzing the requirements of the Army's FCS fires and effects systems and use those requirements to design and build an early prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Our Phase II effort will refine the architecture; upgrade the prototype to interface to a fire support system such as AFATDS, then field the prototype to participate in exercises and technology demonstrations.
