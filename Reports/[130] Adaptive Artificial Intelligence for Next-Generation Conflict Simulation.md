Adaptive Artificial Intelligence for Next-Generation Conflict Simulation
========================================================================

# Abstract


Computer wargames and combat simulation software has reached a very high level of comprehensiveness and sophistication in terms of modeling fidelity and accurate results.  The recently released simulation titled Point of Attack-2, in particular, affords users a very powerful combat simulation package in a desktop PC environment.  At the same time, however, the increased complexity of the system makes a reasonably competent and challenging AI more important than ever, principally because the complexity makes operating the game much more difficult for human players.  Thus, in order for the program to be accessible, let alone entertaining and enjoyable, the AI must be capable of &quot;assisting&quot; the player in a wide range of situations.    Competent AI additionally serves the function of making the game more realistic by taking control away from players in certain appropriate situations and having units act reasonably  (as when units run or take cover, or retreat without explicit orders), and also providing users of the software with an effective training and learning tool.  By being able to act like a live human opponent would, players can see the results or their actions and strategies in a much more realistic &quot;real-world&quot; environment, without the time, resources, or personnel required for a multi-human player situation.
