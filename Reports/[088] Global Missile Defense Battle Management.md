Global Missile Defense Battle Management
========================================

# Abstract


An effective Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) must be able to make decisions that maximize engagement success—the destruction of critical missile threats—while doing so in an efficient manner so as not to waste critical defense assets that may be needed to handle further threats. However, such decisions are often made and carried out at more localized subsystems, allowing for increased robustness and faster response time. This distribution of decision making makes achieving global optimization goals more difficult, as it requires that defense subsystems and components work together effectively. Aware of these issues, MDA is seeking solutions for aiding in the development of robust, real-time battle management algorithms and software to support layered missile defense. EDAptive Computing, Inc. team proposes ADROIT, which will result in an innovative and commercially viable prototype system whose architecture and processes will maximize engagement success while optimizing inventories. Through innovative Artificial Intelligence algorithms embedded into a flexible and intuitive simulation framework, ADROIT can facilitate the development of robust and effective battle management systems, and potentially other complex decision making applications.
