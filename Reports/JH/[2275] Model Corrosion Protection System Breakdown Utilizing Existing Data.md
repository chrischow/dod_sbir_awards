Model Corrosion Protection System Breakdown Utilizing Existing Data
===================================================================

# Abstract


The overall goal of this Phase II effort is to produce an Expert Coating Analysis Tool (ECAT) which will allow Corrosion Engineering, Logistics/Maintenance and Acquisition Planning Specialist within the Navy to make intelligent, educated decisions concerning the integrity of coatings used throughout the Navy.  ECAT will use information obtained with data mining tools and/or provided by the user on the initial state and condition of the coating system.  This will be integrated with an internal Knowledge Base, containing expert knowledge acquired from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and from laboratory and field test data and observations.  ECAT will also include a Knowledge Acquisition Facility that will utilize both automated machine-learning algorithms and a user interface for direct user input into the Knowledge Base.  In this way ECAT can continue to grow robustly over time.   The most important functionality of the Phase II effort will be developing a risk assessment of the coatingâ€™s life cycle for maintenance purpose. This will require probabilistic reasoning to assess the cost effectiveness of coating selection over a long period of time, based on a number of factors that are not well quantified and not fixed over the coating lifetime.
