High Performance Computing (HPC) for AEGIS Combat Systems Test Bed (CSTB)
=========================================================================

# Abstract


As our nation encounters continuously evolving threats to the warfighter, simulators are critical to the development and advancement of Naval combat systems. Simulators provide the capability to execute scenarios under similar input conditions to that of a tactically deployed platform. The Combat System Test Bed (CSTB) is a key Navy Modeling and Simulation (M&S) solution allowing users to simulate AEGIS Combat System (ACS) capability at a fraction of the cost and risk than that of a live Naval test event. The CSTB comprises a federation of individual models and rehosted tactical code running across a heterogeneous environment of desktops and servers. As the CSTB continues to evolve, higher fidelity models, more taxing scenarios, and increased throughput to allow for more extensive Monte Carlo simulations will be required. A platform is required to enable the CSTB to scale into the High-Performance Computing environments to take advantage of all available compute resources. IDT proposes a virtualization platform to enable the allocation of the CSTB federation’s computing resources and minimize simulation runtime by, using Machine Learning techniques, dynamically reacting to systems’ resource needs. The platform will integrate a User Interface from which a single user can initiate, monitor, and assess simulations.
