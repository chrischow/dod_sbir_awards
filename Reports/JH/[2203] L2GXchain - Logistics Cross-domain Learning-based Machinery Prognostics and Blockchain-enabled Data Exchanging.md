L2GXchain: Logistics Cross-domain Learning-based Machinery Prognostics and Blockchain-enabled Data Exchanging
=============================================================================================================

# Abstract


Digital logistic support systems share information for goods and services, increase supply-chain velocity between partners, and ensure mission continuity. These systems have been shown to be surprisingly fragile, and largely susceptible to problems caused by external events (COVID19, etc.). InfoBeyond advocates L2GXchain (Logistics Cross-domain Learning-based Machinery Prognostics and Blockchain-enabled Data Exchanging Framework. L2GXchain enables decentralized cross-domain dynamic data sharing, dynamic data routing, and machine-learning based machinery prognostics to improve the resiliency of remote logistic information systems. L2GXchain allows participation of all domains (e.g., classified, unclassified, etc.) and provides a trusted common operational picture of logistic data sharing status and remote system situational awareness. L2GXchain is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric platform (Smart Contract-enabled) and integrates role/attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC) for preserving logistic information privacy. Smart Contracts provide powerful automation capabilities and enable state-of-the-art dynamic data sharing/routing. At each domain-spanned endpoint, machine learning-based Big Data analytics are used to perform condition-based maintenance (CBM) prediction of remote machinery systems. Additionally, by using fog-computing and database replication strategy at each domain-spanning endpoint, L2GXchain enhances the speed at which mission critical logistic information is transmitted across domains, even when bandwidth is scarce. L2GXchain drastically increase the agility, resiliency, and security of cross-domain logistic systems.
