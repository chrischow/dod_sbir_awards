Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare Contextual Reasoning
===================================================

# Abstract


Planning for anti-submarine missions requires the TASW Battle Watch Captain to understand the intentions of the enemy based on a vast context of information. There are many factors that these watch standers use to draw their conclusions. Everything from weather to recent hostilities can affect their decision making. An opportunity exists to create an automatic tool for assessing theater-wide ASW situations by leveraging state of the art expert systems technology to assist the TASW Battle Watch Captain. Discovery Machine, Inc. (DMI) in partnership with Arorae Corporation (together the DMI team) proposes to leverage the DM Knowledge Service Modeler (KSM) to create a TASW console. The DM Knowledge Service Modeler is an open and extensible architecture based on artificial intelligence and knowledge capture software. Our research has resulted in technology that enables subject matter experts (SMEs) to capture and deploy their own expertise into decision support systems resulting in better automation and increased performance of personnel. DMI's technology does not require the experts to write code. It builds on how SMEs currently assess a situation, and applies expertise to automate and assist.
