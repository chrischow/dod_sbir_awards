ACT: An Artificial Intelligence based Course of Action Tool
===========================================================

# Abstract


Current Course of Action (COA) decision aids and Maritime Mission Planning Systems (MMPS) do not adequately meet ever-changing operational needs in highly contested, degraded, and operationally limited (CDO) environments. It is ultimately necessary to develop a mission planner decision aid that enables Automated Decision Support (ADS) utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Leaning (ML) to provide timely and effective employment of maritime resources. To address this need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to design and develop an AEGIS weapon system-compliant AI-based COA software tool to improve the Navyâ€™s 3-phase mission planning capability. ACT will provide automated situational awareness analysis, deep learning-trained COA decision making, and adversarial reasoning-based COA evaluation as key enablers for near real-time antifragile mission planning.
