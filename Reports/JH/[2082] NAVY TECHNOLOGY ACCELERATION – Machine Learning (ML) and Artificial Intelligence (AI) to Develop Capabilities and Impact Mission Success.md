NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION – Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The high-level objective for this Phase II research and development effort is to complete the development of the robust, adaptive, Multi-Agent Learning Systems for Cognitive Autonomous Sensor Processing (CASP) architecture and demonstrate the capabilities for unmanned, autonomous operation of UASs.  This will provide the capabilities for supporting continuous, adaptive learning, and mission management decision making support to provide timely, accurate sensor collection and processing for the Navy system integration and execution.  This will include a prototype of the CASP Artificial Cognitive Neural Framework (ACNF) cognitive processing infrastructure required to manage and execute the CASP cognitive system.  We will advance sensor processing algorithms developed in Phase I to encompass several more sensor types and algorithm types, providing a sensor fusion suite of tools applicable to a variety of Naval missions and operations.  The Phase II demonstration will provide a proof-of-concept for the CASP ACNF cognitive framework.  This will include demonstration of utilities and sensor fusion capabilities required for a specified program of record.
