Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease
=============================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary/Abstract
New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular
disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary
CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of
progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that
prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome
the barriers – a new approach is needed.
Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer
Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked
to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy;
vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software
available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect
accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to
effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it
achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid
mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel
reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP
has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS.
Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved
meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through
direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to
pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse
events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on
the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial
intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of
available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale
up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials.
While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support
multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also,
vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These
attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.Project Narrative
Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of
progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that
prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not
overcome. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP that overcomes
these barriers to provide truly effective non-invasive diagnostic power to fill gaps in treating at-risk patients.
