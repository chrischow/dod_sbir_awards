NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION- Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
=======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have the potential to deliver significant value and impact throughout the Navy's operations and specifically in the area of predictive maintenance. In order to fully realize this potential, a framework is proposed to address the need for deployable predictive maintenance models that can maintain accuracy over time and can diagnose new fault patterns, which are key issues in the performance and adoption of predictive maintenance solutions. This framework would leverage various pre-processing and feature extraction techniques, such as data segmentation by operating mode, normalizing data to account for ambient conditions, comparing actual sensor values to physical model predicted values, and calculating various features from the sensor data. This solution will provide more robust early detection and more accurate diagnosis with less false alarms, which correlate to the business objectives of having actionable information and improved fleet availability. If the proposed technical objectives can be achieved, we envision that this capability will provide a significant improvement in the current predictive maintenance solutions that are deployed with the Navyâ€™s aircraft fleet, as well as fleets in a number of commercial applications.
