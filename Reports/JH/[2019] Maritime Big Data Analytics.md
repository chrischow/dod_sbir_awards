Maritime Big Data Analytics
===========================

# Abstract


Chesapeake Technology International's (CTI's) proposed solution for the "Maritime Big Data Analytics" small business innovative research (SBIR) program is the Omen Open Big Data Analytic Platform. Omen can be used to provide airborne processing of terabytes of sensor data while synchronizing to afloat and ashore enclaves via a roll-on tactical cloudlet approach. CTI's solution will build on experience and open-source solutions to build a Government open marketplace of analyst notebooks capable of characterizing high-dimensional data resulting in actionable intelligence. Novel techniques such as Machine Vision and Deep Learning will be explored within the Phase I for the applicability to the maritime domain. Over the course of the SBIR program CTI will further refine the Omen architecture to enable complex legacy system integration and analytic innovation over massive amounts of sensor data to support the maritime patrol warfighter.
