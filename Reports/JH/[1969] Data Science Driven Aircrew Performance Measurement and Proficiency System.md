Data Science Driven Aircrew Performance Measurement and Proficiency System
==========================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is to develop a Data Science Driven Aircrew Performance Measurement and Proficiency System (AviatorDX). AviatorDX will integrate data collection and fusion of metrics from multiple modalities in order to provide a set of comprehensive performance measures for Live, Virtual and Constructive flight training exercises. Our approach is to adapt and exploit advanced data science approaches, including Bayesian inference technology, to develop an optimal data solicitation schema that will improve its competency estimation model through machine learning as it gains experience. Perceptronics Solutions recognizes the criticality of performance assessment as an element of effective training. For this project, we will leverage two directly related previous Navy efforts; these are: (1) MPMS (Multi-Modal Performance Measurement System) is an assessment tool that will capture performance data from a variety of live, virtual, and constructive sources. MPMS will also provide data-derived performance measures, identify skill deficits, trace deficit sources, and prescribe remediative performance enhancing evolutions. (2) DECIDE (Diagnostic Engine for Cognitive Improvement and Decision Effectiveness) will provide AviatorDX with an innovative methodology for observer-based training assessment, diagnosis and improvement. We will adapt and extend the capabilities of DECIDE and MPMS to meet the goals of the AviatorDX project.
