Intelligent Additive Manufacturing- Metals
==========================================

# Abstract


Although metal AM technologies have continued to progress, there are still many different challenging factors to a build that impact part quality and the amount of time it takes to successfully process a first-run component without defects. Triton Systems proposes to develop a machine learning algorithm that adjusts print parameters during the build in reaction to in-situ sensor data in order to produce higher quality parts in less time. The proposed system will monitor the build, adjust the laser energy in response to the sensors, log the physical characteristics for training purposes, and link everything together with artificial intelligence.
