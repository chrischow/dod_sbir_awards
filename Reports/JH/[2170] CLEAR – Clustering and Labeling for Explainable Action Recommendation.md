CLEAR â€“ Clustering and Labeling for Explainable Action Recommendation
=====================================================================

# Abstract


Strategy games and intelligent agents can provide operational planners with means to test and verify different plans and strategies, enabling faster and more efficient planning, execution, and evaluation of a mission. The main challenge to develop such intelligent agents is coping with the complexity of the operational environment, which requires a representation with large numbers of states and actions. To address this challenge and develop effective decision aid in warfighting domains, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes CLEAR (Clustering and Labeling for Explainable Action Recommendation), a solution to provide timely and explainable decision aid for mission planning and re-planning. CLEAR seeks to bridge the gap between recent advances in explainable machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning and the use of such techniques to devise intelligent agents capable to play strategy games in their full complexity, and ultimately provide recommendations for strategic planning and acting.
