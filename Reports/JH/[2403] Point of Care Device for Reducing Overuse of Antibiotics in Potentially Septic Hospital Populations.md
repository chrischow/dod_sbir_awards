Project Summary 
At least    percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary  This has obviously catastrophic
implications for the future of humanity  Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an
annual toll of over         people  Survival rates have been reported to drop by      per hour appropriate
treatment is delayed  This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital
settings  A dominant factor underlying this behavior is the lack of rapid methods to determine whether or not
an individualized patient would actually benefit from the intended course of antibiotics  Furthermore  if a course
of antibiotics are chosen to be administered  it is not clear how to optimize the de escalation of the antibiotics 
This results in a blanket antibiotics approach  where nearly every patient with even a possibility of sepsis is dosed
with broad spectrum antibiotics and stays on these antibiotics for far longer than is necessary 
Procalcitonin  PCT  has shown much promise in recent years as a potential discriminator between bacterial and
viral infections  Various assays for PCT from company such as bioMerieux and Roche have received    k
clearance from the FDA for use by physicians in optimizing the administration of antibiotics  In addition 
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome  SIRS  criteria are often used as rough indications of a global
inflammatory problem in patients  Of these four criteria  WBC count  respiratory rate  heart rate  and
temperature   only the WBC count is not currently possible to measure outside of clinical labs  A handheld device
that could combine both a WBC count and a plasma PCT measurement from a drop of blood in    minutes could
revolutionize the administration of antibiotics in acute care settings  In particular  obtaining the first
measurement of both PCT and WBC as early as possible before arrival to Emergency Departments is critical 
Ideally this would be obtained in the most common  funnels  into the acute care EDs  including outpatient 
ambulatory  and nursing home settings  Several studies have shown that the temporal trends of these two
parameters can be very powerful for further adjustments to the administered antibiotics  For example  Roche s
Elecsys BRAHMS PCT system recommends that a PCT measurement is performed at both day   and day    and
that the difference should be used to inform optimization of the antibiotics 
ElectroCyt  Inc  is an early stage company that has raised $   M in investment and has licensed its core
technology from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  The company aims to develop a hand held
electronic reader with an accompanying pipeline of cartridge designs to measure a variety of cell counts  cell
surface receptor expression levels  and plasma protein expression levels  Our first cartridge will measure a total
WBC count and PCT from a drop of blood  The company has signed an exciting joint development agreement
 JDA  with Foxconn Interconnect Technologies  FIT  to co develop the low cost prototype cartridge and hand 
held readers  letter attached   In addition  ElectroCyt has also established two clinical partnerships with
hospitals to perform clinical studies  letters attached  to build a unique combined biomarker EMR dataset  This
dataset  when combined with machine learning for predictive analytics and the patient s latest biomarker
readings  will provide real time feedback to physicians as to a patient s overall  immune state score   This score
could be used as individualized evaluation of how well a patient is recovering or not recovering from a septic
event  which can help physicians adjust course of antibiotics with real time feedback  In this project  we will
adapt our core technology  which has focused on cell measurements  to enable plasma protein measurements as
well  In addition  we will continue to perform clinical studies to build the unique combined biomarker   EMR
dataset at three clinical sites  University of Chicago Main Hospital  Carle Foundation Hospital and Order of Saint

Project Narrative 
At least    percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary  This has obviously
catastrophic implications for the future of humanity  Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United

in hospital settings  ElectroCyt  Inc  is an early stage company that has raised angel investment and licensed its
core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  The company aims to develop a system to
more intelligently optimize the use of and potential de escalation of antibiotics in acute care settings  The
system consists of a hand held electronic reader and accompanying pipeline of disposable cartridges to
measure cell counts  cell surface protein expression  and plasma protein expression from a drop of blood 
Measurement of the blood biomarkers combined with a predictive analytics machine learning approach will
accurately capture the patient s immune state as a progression of recovery from an adverse event  This system 
consisting of a device to measure biomarkers rapidly from blood and a machine learning algorithm  could
provide real time feedback to physicians describing an individual patient s specific response to the
administered antibiotics  This could help to eliminate unnecessary antibiotics while the pathogen is being
identified and to de escalate the antibiotics at higher susceptibility to resistance much faster
