Real time video monitoring of falls in memory care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer s and related dementias
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


In the US  Alzheimer s disease  AD  is the single most expensive disease  the only disease in the 
top six for which the number of deaths is increasing  The greatest cost contributors are frequent 
hospitalizations  where falls are the largest culprit  and frequent need for assistance with the 
activities of daily living  A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase 
quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events  e g   detecting falls before a 
fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls   Unfortunately  current safety devices 
require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of 
showing caregivers how falls occur 

Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense  also known as SafelyYou   an online fall detection 
system with off the shelf wall mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and 
related dementias  ADRD   enabled by a human in the loop  HIL   The HIL will confirm the fall 
detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms  We will demonstrate it for     
patients in    memory care facilities  Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for 
specific patients  for ex   some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should 
be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night  It does not require action of individuals 
  caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well suited for individuals with ADRD  
We leverage our HIL paradigm  in which our deep learning  a subfield of artificial intelligence  
approaches identify and pre filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human  who will 
call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events  falls   The human can monitor 
several facilities at a given time 

This project leverages the already recruited     patients in our partner    memory care facilities  
recruited through our previous  IRB approved  pilot  The work will leverage our previous three 
pilots 
  Pilot    We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof of concept data 
containing     acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection 
  Pilot    We demonstrated acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs by patients  family and staff  
through the collection of   months of video data at WindChime of Marin  a memory care facility from 
the Integral Senior Living network  in which we identified   total hours of fall data  This led to 
clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from    and    in the first   months to   in the 
final month  due to video review with care staff 
  Pilot    ongoing   We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in 
   facilities of the Carlton  Integral Senior Living  Pacifica and SRG networks  totaling     
patients already monitored by our system  offline  
The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the     cameras in these facilities into a 
real time fall detection system which will run online for   months with a      HIL support  
Compared to a   month baseline from the     cameras recording with the detection offline  we 
hypothesize this real time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in 
time on the ground after a fall  fall related hospitalizations  and length of hospital stay 
following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with      
participants        The proposed NestSense system uses off the shelf wall mounted cameras to perform detection of 
safety critical events for Alzheimer s disease and related dementia patients in memory care 
facilities  It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers  e g   through wearing 
any kind of device   The NestSense technology provides the first robust non wearable fall detection 
tuned specifically to the privacy security tradeoffs of dementia care  It provides an answer to 
today s technology gaps  far from      reliability  by use of a Human in the Loop  HIL  paradigm to 
enable a quick rollout of the technology  Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of 
our system by patients  family  and memory care staff in the Carlton  Integral Senior Living  
Pacifica and SRG networks  we have deployed the system in offline mode in    facilities of the 
network  monitoring     patients  The research  implementation  and deployment work encompassed in 
this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof 
of concept  operational in real time mode  with HIL  to reduce fall related hospitalizations and 
time spent on the ground  The pilot follows   previous pilots  the most recent of which deploys 
cameras with these     patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of 
occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care  This study will translate those cameras 
into a real time fall  online  detection system which will run online for   months with a      HIL 
support  Compared to a   month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline  we 
hypothesize this real time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in 
time on the ground after a fall  fall related hospitalizations  and length of hospital stay 
following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with      participants
