Enabling BLOS UAS Operations through a Diverse-Source Global Positioning System
===============================================================================

# Abstract


Enabling BLOS operations in the National Airspace System is largely an issue of improved sensing. Under the UTM rules, BLOS operations require performance authorization from the FAA centered around navigation, communications, sharing of intent, avoiding other aircraft, and connecting to the FAA in near real-time. The current plan initially is for these performance metrics to be evaluated by the FAA case-bycase, but as experience is gained by FAA reviewers, standard packages of operational plans and technological capabilities will lead to streamlined approvals. Based on past experience working with the FAA, Black Swift Technologies has identified that remote operations will require several new and improved capabilities. One of those capabilities is the focus of this effort, to provide position information in GPS-denied areas during BLOS operations through an augmented sensor suite and machine learning capabilities. The system will be capable of providing accurate localization through several sources without the use of GPS. It will be grounded in the UTM rules, allowing an unmanned aircraft to continue providing position information to the UAS Service Supplier in the event of GPS jamming or spoofing
