AI-Based Trend and Sentiment Analytics for Latent-Risk Discovery
================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal for the intelligent Persistent AI based Threat Detection (PAIT) system addresses the critical problems of detecting and responding to human-generated threats. Military analysts face the daunting challenge of continually identifying, classifying, and responding to human initiated threats quickly and with limited personnel. The rise of the internet and social media exacerbates this challenge. Advanced solutions making full use of modern AI technology are required to support military analysts in this endeavor. Our PAIT solution uses artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to detect emerging human-generated physical threats to military installations by monitoring open source and security-related data sets. Our innovative and agile approach includes analyzing potentially threatening individuals and groups of individuals in the context of their overall networks of relationships across disparate data sources, using advanced artificial intelligence methods to learn to automatically detect patterns of threatening behavior in the data, and alerting military analysts to identified threats with supporting evidence and analysis that is designed to facilitate immediate action to address the threat. We are confident of our success in PAIT development because of our ability to leverage our extensive past work in building and applying AI-based systems for monitoring and applying open source data.
