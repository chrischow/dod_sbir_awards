Dynamic Modeling of Safe Routes
===============================

# Abstract


Applied Visions, Inc. (AVI) proposes to develop an Adaptive Visualization of Safe Optimized Routes (AVIsor) - a tool that will assist route planners in identifying and visualizing safe convoy paths in the dynamic urban battlespace. AVIsor will build upon our work on a similar SBIR project sponsored by the Navy for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon program. The result of that effort, the Tactical Target Analysis and Prediction System (TTAPS), uses computer gaming technology, including agent-based artificial intelligence algorithms, to predict the likely destinations and paths of targets vehicles. For this project we will adapt that technology to efficiently generate and visualize safe convoy paths based on multiple regional factors including civilian reaction, local infrastructure, traffic and  their effects on the choice of best paths though the road network.
