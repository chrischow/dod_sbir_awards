Validation of Artificial Intelligence Technologies (VAIT)
=========================================================

# Abstract


As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more ubiquitous in society and the DoD enterprise, trust in the results provided by AI is of paramount importance. Therefore, R-DEX Systems (R-DEX) proposes to build on the successful Phase I to increase the TRL of the groundbreaking Validation of Artificial Intelligence Technologies (VAIT), an innovative processing suite for increasing trust in AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and improving robustness against adversarial attacks. VAIT is a multi-level, multi- pronged approach that couples standard techniques for strengthening AI/ML algorithms with innovative complementary classifiers, cross-domain classifiers, and anytime processing with parallel meta-learner networks. In Phase II, R-DEX will mature and prototype VAIT using EO, SAR, and ISAR imagery. A key focus of Phase II is achieving system performance that meets program metrics and transition benchmarks for the Sponsor and other government and commercial applications. Throughout the project, R-DEX will work closely with the Sponsor and R-DEXâ€™s strategic partners to ensure successful transition of VAIT for a wide range of government and commercial applications. In addition, R-DEX will work with strategic partners to perform Phase II verification and validation experiments.
