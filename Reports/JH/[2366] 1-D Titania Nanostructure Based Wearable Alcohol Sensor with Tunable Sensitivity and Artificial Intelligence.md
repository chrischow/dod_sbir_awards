============================================================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearablenoninvasivesmartand aestheticThe aimin Phase Iis to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metali eCobaltfunctionalized Titanium nanotubesTiNTto detectmonitorand display blood alcohol levels in
real time using microcontrollers based wrist band like devicesAt the core of our innovationwe have Cobaltfunctionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin inppm level that
can be tuned down toppb level as welli esensitivity of the sensor is tunableThe control unit of our system
is reusablesensors are replaceablethe microcontrollers are equipped with a micro SD card for personal data
storageand the proposed unit has a built in wireless system for data transmissionThis proposal also aimsin
Phase IIto create an integrated artificially intelligentAInetwork that will have the capabilities ofatranslating
the real time data into a pre cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety
features through a wireless signali eBluetoothandcadaptively taking unattended decisions on demandDoDthrough machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicatedProject Narrative
Breath analyzers within the law enforcement settings alone cannot tackle the problems
associated with alcohol consumptions and abuseRecently developed wearable alcohol sensor
technologies mostly rely on wet electrochemical environments around the skinThereforewe
propose to develop wearable alcohol sensor using titania nanotube which will be drynoninvasiveartificially intelligentand aestheticWe also aim to integrate these sensors through
machine learning for taking unattended decisions on demand under influence
