# Abstract


Project Summary This project is to complete the developmentintegration with the electronic medical record and human testing of the InheRET Inherited Risk Evaluation ToolInheRET s aim is to quickly and easily identify individuals at increased risk for hereditary diseasesthereby facilitating their to access downstream risk appropriate carereducing morbidity and mortalityInheRET s unique features reduces clinical ascertainment barriers by gathering a patient provided family historyproduces a report based on patient and family history that streamlines workflows and enhances patient outcomes and cost effectiveness within health systemsThe aims for this project are to complete in silicocomputer generatedtesting of the algorithms driving the InheRET data analytics for the case of cancer riskfollowed by pilot testing in a variety of clinical settings to determine if further refinements are needed to the productprior to commercializationAs part of this STTR projectwe will integrate the InheRET program with an EPIC electronic health record system to seamlessly communicate InheRET reports within the patient medical recordsto be accessible to both patient and practitionerSuccess will be determined if we achieveconcordance with the in silico testingi econcluding that all algorithms function correctlyconcordance with clinical determinations in the clinical pilot testingandconcordance in the integration testingall patient reports are appropriately routed to the proper medical recordsOur primary objective is to produce an accurateeasy to use and understandable report to ensure individuals who may unknowingly harbor inherited genetic mutations are identifiedthereby enabling them to access genetic counselors and testing along with appropriate downstream careBy doing sopatients can reduce their risk of diseasereceive tailored treatment if they incur diseaseand reduce overall mortalityMoreoverInheRET will cut costs by assisting in focusing resources on those whose risk warrants enhanced measuresConverselyby reducing incidence of hereditary cancers or the advanced presentation of cancers or other hereditary chronic illnessesa multitude of costs associated with complex treatments can likewise be reducedwhile increasing quality and length of life Project Narrative This project is to complete the developmentintegration and testing of the InheRET Inherited Risk Evaluation ToolInheRET s aim is to quickly and easily identify individuals at increased risk for hereditary diseases enabling them to access downstream carereducing morbidity and mortalityInheRET s unique features reduces clinical ascertainment barriersstreamlines workflows and enhances profitability within health systems
