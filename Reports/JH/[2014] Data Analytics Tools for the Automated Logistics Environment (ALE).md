Data Analytics Tools for the Automated Logistics Environment (ALE)
==================================================================

# Abstract


In this research effort, GTD Unlimited will develop a toolset that leverages machine learning and analytics to analyze E-2Dâ€™s system maintenance with Automated Logistics Environment (ALE) data collected across the fleet to design and develop improved maintenance procedures that will improve readiness. GTD will determine key performance metrics of the platform that are of value to the maintainer, IPT, and the enterprise (Feature Extraction); implement algorithms to facilitate Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), demonstrate the feasibility of a toolset to analyze ALE data with a Graphical User Interface (GUI); and generate prototype plans for Phase II (Phase II plan).
