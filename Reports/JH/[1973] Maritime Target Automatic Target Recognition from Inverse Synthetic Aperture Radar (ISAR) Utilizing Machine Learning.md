Maritime Target Automatic Target Recognition from Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) Utilizing Machine Learning
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


EMSI proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of extending our machine-learning-based SAR classifiers to provide real-time high confidence maritime target identification from ISAR data collected and processed onboard Tomahawk and other high-speed weapons. To this end, we will modify our classifier architectures to accommodate target motion and missile SWAP constraints, simulate realistic ISAR data sets, and to determine: which ISAR features are salient to ship identification and to which physical features they correspond; and what ATR performance is achievable from a missile platform, as a function of ship type, environmental and radar parameters, and missile trajectory.
