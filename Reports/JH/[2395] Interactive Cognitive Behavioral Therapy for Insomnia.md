Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia
=====================================================

# Abstract


Abstract
This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using state of the art voicecontrolled intelligent assistants to deliver automated cognitive behavioral therapy for insomniaCBT Ifor breast cancer survivorsBCSwho suffer from higher rates of insomnia than the
general populationInsomnia has numerous detrimental health consequences and too few welltrained CBT I therapists are available to offer treatmentThe user will interact with voice
recognition through spoken voice dialogs with an internet connected speaker instead of a
computer and keyboardThe long term goal is to provide acceptable CBT I with voice
recognition instead of cumbersomein person visits or web basedbright computer screensIn
our specific aimsour multidisciplinary team will invite breast cancer survivors with insomnia to
inform development of a voice accessible prototypeWe will build and debug the prototype
before conducting feasibility testing to assess the prototype s acceptability with BCSThe
central hypothesis is that the majority of participants will report satisfaction with the intervention
and express interest in using it for CBT I at homeWe also anticipate that participants will gain
knowledge of CBT I and insomnia treatment through interaction with the deviceThis
intervention includes engaging and educational elementsand multiple areas of innovation
which overcome current impediments to the delivery of scalableautomated CBT IWe
anticipate that the results will demonstrate feasibilityand will provide data to inform a Phase II
study testing the efficacy of the CBT I system on insomnia through a randomized controlled trial
as well as more feedback on usability of the system throughout developmentThis contribution
is significantbecause successful completion of Phase I aims will demonstrate how this product
might advance the effective implementation of an evidence based therapy that can scale to the
growing population of breast cancer survivors with insomnia who lack access to trained CBT I
therapists Project Narrative
We aim to develop and test delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia using
an Artificial Intelligence home device among breast cancer survivorsThe aims of this
study are to understand survivor preferencesdevelop an AI prototypeand test usability
of the programbefore testing efficacy in a Phase II trial
