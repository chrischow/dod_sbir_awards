Electronic Warfare Events Logging Automation
============================================

# Abstract


To address the Navy’s need for an automated event logging system that captures and assimilates information related to electronic warfare (EW) events, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to further the development of the Electronic Warfare Events Logging Automation (EELA) software that was produced under NAVSEA Phase I Contract Number N68335-19-C-0635. During Phase II, EELA will be enhanced to interface with the SLQ-32 data stream and log emitter data. Interfaces will also be developed to enable EELA to connect with the EW operator console. Included in the plan will be the development of an EW display emulation software prototype that will allow EELA’s evaluation in the context of achievable operator workload reduction for tasks related to emitter identification, logging, and reporting. POC will also build a new feature that will aggregate emitter data from multiple distributed sources, correlate emitter data, and validate it against the information from other external systems or databases. Another feature of EELA that can be extended to provide improved EW situational awareness will be its capability to support analytics and machine learning (ML). We will work on getting EELA ready for TRL-7, conduct an extensive evaluation of EELA’s functionality and improve the effectiveness/usability of the human/machine interface.
