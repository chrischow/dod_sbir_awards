A Multi-Scale Model for Large Aluminum Forging Parts
====================================================

# Abstract


Naval Aviation aircraft procurement faces cost and schedule challenges, largely due to high scrap rate of large airframe aluminum forging parts. The parts were rejected due to geometrical non-conformance, mostly due to distortion induced right after the quenching step. There is a need to develop a prediction tool to run simulations with optimized quenching parameters yielding least post-quenching distortion. Most simulation tools are not sufficiently accurate and do not include all three fields: thermal, mechanical and metallurgical. The Navy seeks an innovative multi-physics-based and machine learning tool that optimizes the quenching process, where the model inputs covers all three fields with a comprehensive understanding and control of residual stresses.   In Phase I, Triton will develop concepts for one or more physics-based simulation tool that models heat transfer, stress/strain evolution and phase transformation. We will demonstrate feasibility of the simulation model and perform proof-of-concept demonstration to asses the design’s Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL). Triton will also develop a Phase II plan to deliver a prototype.   In Phase II, Triton will further develop our multi-physic simulation model. We will perform experiments on coupon/component/full-scale to verify and validate our simulation model. In addition to assessing and updating the TRL/MRL, we will also demonstrate technology transition and commercialization feasibility.   In Phase III, Triton will transition and commercialize our developed multi-physics simulation tool as an analytical software package. We will deliver a detailed verification and validation plan and demonstrate the application capability for the selected airframe components of any interested aircraft platform.
