Target Identification Interrogation Data Stream Analytics System
================================================================

# Abstract


Mosaic will deploy “pattern of life” machine learning models that harness large real-time and historical surveillance data collected and fused by the Extensible Collaboration and Analytics Platform. X-CAP is a global, all-source, simplified information environment built on scalable frameworks to assist Air Defense operators to accomplish effective combat identification. X-CAP is transitioning into the Minotaur Family of Services (MFoS) for implementation into the P-8 Poseidon and is sponsored by OPNAV N98 for fleet experimentation. MFoS currently uses advanced information technology to support national-tactical integration, high side fusion, and combat systems integration. MFoS collection will allow machine learning applications to capture data on specific airframes in the world database and train a time-stamped CID model. The algorithms are dynamic, continuously updated, and will train regularly using world-wide data on Minotaur Web which will allow ships to connect when the tactical situation allows. Cloud connectivity is not required for the algorithms to run inference. IWS-1’s virtual twin initiative provides an opportunity to deploy this agile computational environment to run shipboard real-time inference of AEGIS combat system tracks against the model. This approach will provide backward compatibility to the USS Monterey test ship demonstration as well as validate applicability for future combat systems.
