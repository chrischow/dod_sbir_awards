Phase II- HazPrep Worker Training- Community Risk Profile- COVID-19 Rapid Response
==================================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
COVID-19 Supplement to HazPrep Phase II. Original Summary: A workerandapos;s personal hazard profile (PHP) is a
function of hazards present and his/her exposure level to those hazards. Workers with an elevated level of risk
are those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste
generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response. inXsolâ€™s Phase I feasibility study
verified the appeal and effectiveness of a new form of crowdsourced social learning platform. Our approach
using cloud technology creates a dynamically growing library of incidents/scenarios, highly personalized
(occupation/task/geo) risk profile and generates learning activities to train on risk awareness and mitigation
techniques. The Phase II proposal includes implementation of an innovative use of big data algorithms for
community profiles and fusion with PHP allowing for targeted and personalized training completing the HazPrep
prototype developed and exercised by our beta test team in Phase I.PROJECT NARRATIVE
COVID-19 Supplement to HazPrep Phase II. Original Narrative: HazPrep is a new form of a social learning
platform which includes crowdsourcing and machine learning AI to formulate personalized learning activities at
risk workers with an elevated level of risk such as those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working
around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency
response. Actual incidents are ingested from OSHA, NFIRS and other sources as scenarios/case studies.
