Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health
=====================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big
Data Analytics StackBDASto support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision SupportCDSapplicationsThis platform will make it fastereasierand less expensive to develop molecular
Clinical Decision Support SystemsThese systems require real time queries of globally
distributed dataefficient machine learning on large genomic datasetsand must be securefault tolerant and scalableBDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet
these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational
platformTo encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large
genomic datasetswe will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance
for Genomics and HealthGA GH
