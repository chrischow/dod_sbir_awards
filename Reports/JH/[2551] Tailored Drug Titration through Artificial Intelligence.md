# Abstract


Optima Integrated Health IncOptimaproposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support
technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trialoptima BPoptima BP is
designed as a physician decision action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment
independent of in office visitsfor patients with uncontrolled hypertensionHTNoptima BP is designed to
reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of strokeheart failureHFor myocardial
infarctionMIevents resulting from high blood pressureBPabove goalUncontrolled HTN affectsmillion
AmericansThe cost of HTN associated hospitalizations is $billionorof all hospital costswith rtmillion Emergency DptmEDvisitsoptima BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patientsand reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare systemOur long term objective is to help drive the
transformation from the reactive pay for service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care
through personalized health surveillanceassessmentand action via timely and safely optimized medication
treatmentOur specific aims includeAimdemonstrating the efficacy of optima BP in a randomized clinical
trialnpatientsdeployed at UC San Francisco Medical CenterPatients will be randomized to an
enhanced careECarm or an optima BP armO BPAll patients will use OmronBP arm cuff to remotely
measure their BPFor the patients in the EC armphysicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the
OmrondataFor patients in the O BP armaside from the BP monthly summaryphysicians will receiveaa risk stratified patient rosterbnext step actions in medication optimization for each patientandcaccess
to optima BP s secure web service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient
data could affect medication choicee gchange in medication choice if BP goal is loweredWe will then
examine the BP value reduction between armssuccess rtmmHg decreased systolicrtmmHg decreased
diastolic of O BP vsECalong with secondary outcomes between O BP and ECmedication treatment
action frequencyED admissions due to HTN related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for strokeHF
or MIand overall cost of HTN managementAimoptima BP data processing steps will be optimized to
scale up its capability to rtday patient cases processing powerspecific optimization processing tools
will be developedOptima ExtractTransformand LoadOETLOptima Survey GeneratorOSGand Optima

protocolsOSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveyspatient responseand
assignment of patient responses to specific processing modulesOMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of
