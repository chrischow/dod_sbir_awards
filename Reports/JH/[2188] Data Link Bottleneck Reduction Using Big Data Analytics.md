Data Link Bottleneck Reduction Using Big Data Analytics
=======================================================

# Abstract


Both line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) communications links are overwhelmed by the increasing volume of data generated by high quality imaging sensors such as optical, electro-optical, multispectral, hyperspectral, and radio frequency sensors.  Even non-imaging sensors such as electronic support measures can provide raw data streams which saturate communications links, and traditional data reduction techniques may preclude distributed multi platform data reduction techniques such as radio frequency correlation for distributed imaging, classification and identification, and high accuracy contact localization.  Big data techniques to identify and extract relatively low bandwidth actionable information from the data deluge promises to significantly improve the information exfiltration bandwidth challenge.
