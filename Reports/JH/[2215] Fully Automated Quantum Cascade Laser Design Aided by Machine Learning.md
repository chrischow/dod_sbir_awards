Fully Automated Quantum Cascade Laser Design Aided by Machine Learning
======================================================================

# Abstract


Pendar Technologies proposes to develop a QCL simulation tools that leverage machine learning to dramatically improve the speed of QCL device design. The innovative QCL design suite proposed will benefit from recent advances made by Pendar in bandstructure engineering, laser cavity design and thermal management at the chip and the package level.
