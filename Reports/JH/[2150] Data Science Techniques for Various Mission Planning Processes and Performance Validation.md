Data Science Techniques for Various Mission Planning Processes and Performance Validation
=========================================================================================

# Abstract


Mission and planning is a difficult and time-consuming process that places a heavy burden on manpower and critical thinking and is performed under significant pressure. Existing and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are well-suited to assisting humans with these challenges. While the promise of AI/ML is great, there are significant obstacles to operationalizing AI and ML technologies for this problem, both from a technical perspective and from a human perspective. Perceptronics Solutions proposes to provide PMA-281 with our innovative solution: The Multi-Model Optimization Process (MMOP) for high impact AI/ML insertion. The MMOP system is designed to integrate a sequential set of computational and data science models that can determine where to best apply AI to improve the JMPS and subsequent mission planning process. The system generates the places where AI/ML can make the planning more efficient, lead to better outcomes and be likely to succeed by analyzing: (1) importance of a particular decision or activity is to the overall planning outcome; (2) where the system architecture and available data will make the implementation of AI/ML feasible; and (3) where it is likely AI/ML can be created to be better in critical dimensions than human decision-making.
