Rule based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support CDS A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data
===============================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The recognition  diagnosis  and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical
care medicine  The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time critical and
frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal  non specific  age dependent constellation of
clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events  Currently available
EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus based guidelines criteria
have poor sensitivity specificity and or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability  Recent
studies show that  in general  sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common  either in the form of false positives or false
negatives  e g  alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis   As a result such tools
are  at best  modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and  in
infants  can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns 
We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in
sensitivity specificity and positive predictive value  PPV  operating at a clinician specified level of risk  This will
require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models  rules 
natural language processing  embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines  pediatric critical care clinician
expertise  and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine
learning algorithms  Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase   NIH research grant focused on the use of
advanced ontological models combined with  big data  predictive analytics machine learning  ML  techniques
over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS  We demonstrated an AUC of     and PPV in excess of
    for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of         We will leverage these results to establish
exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk
for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis septic shock 
Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance
and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes  Our product development concept
will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows  combined with a
clinician centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and
EMR data sources  Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability 
compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital  that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality
in both critical and non critical care settings Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics antivirals used in hospitals  one third of children who die in U S  tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis  The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome  Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning  machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children
