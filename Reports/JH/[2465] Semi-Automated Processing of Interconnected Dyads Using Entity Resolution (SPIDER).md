# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   The overarching aim of this proposal is to develop and verify a new and innovative software system that will assist researchers in more rigorously constructing social networks  During the past two decades  studies have increasingly employed social network analysis  SNA  to understand HIV and sexually transmitted infections  STI  transmission  The mapping of andquot risk networks andquot  in which individuals are connected by infection spreading ties  has yielded especially valuable insight into the behavioral epidemiology of HIV and STI  and has informed promising interventions designed for people at risk for or living with HIV  However  despite these advances and the burgeoning popularity of SNA based HIV STI research  major methodological and technological challenges are hindering further progress in the field  SNAandapos s ability to catalyze major epidemiologic advances relies on researchersandapos  ability to
construct valid representations of participantsandapos  networks from behavioral data  The standard protocol for constructing risk networks  or identifying direct and indirect relationships among participants and their partners  involves matching participantsandapos  names and demographics with data provided about named partners  This process of identifying and matching duplicate individuals in the network  i e   andquot entity resolutionandquot   ER   is often conducted through laborious  manual cross referencing procedures  These procedures are limited in their reproducibility and may lead to misspecification of network structure  Further complicating valid network construction is that ER criteria are      not formalized      specified differently across studies n various settings and populations  and     rarely  if ever  explained in the published literature  Semi automated tools that combine powerful automated ER processes with capacities for customization and qualitative input have the potential to dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of risk network construction  Current tools for ER in health research tend to focus on a static subset of available ER techniques  e g   similarity in demographics  phonetic based matching techniques  without incorporating state  of the art approaches  e g   machine learning   The proposed software  Semi automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads using Entity Resolution  SPIDER   will provide users with a system that enables efficient  semi automated network construction using a library of robust  statistically rigorous ER algorithms  rich desktop based annotation tools  and secure web based technologies  The customizability of SPIDER will allow for multi disciplinary utility in studies using varying designs and will include innovative features that specifically respond to emerging methodological trends in HIV STI research  The overarching goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and quality of network construction used in research  thereby improving the evidence base for network based interventions that mitigate the spread of HIV    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The overarching aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop and verify a software system that will assist researchers  interventionists  and practitioners in more rigorously constructing social networks  The software  Semi Automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads Using Entity Resolution  SPIDER   will provide users with a system that enables efficient  semi automated risk network construction using a library of robust  advanced entity resolution algorithms  rich desktop based annotation tools  secure web based technologies  and a host of innovative features that specifically respond to emerging methodological trends in HIV STI research  The overarching goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and quality of network methods used in research and practice and to thereby improve the evidence base for network based interventions that mitigate the spread of HIV
