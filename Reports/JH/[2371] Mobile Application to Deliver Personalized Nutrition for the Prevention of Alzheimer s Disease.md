Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer s Disease
==============================================================================================

# Abstract


Genben Lifesciences  dba GB HealthWatch  is a digital health and nutritional genomics company  Our
mission is to help fight common  diet  and lifestyle related chronic diseases with precision nutrition and
advanced mobile technologies  Our company developed the HealthWatch     mobile app for tracking
dietary intake  physical activity and health related symptoms  This mobile app has received excellent
reviews for both the iOS and Android platforms and has over        registered users  Health condition 
specific goals featured in the app provide refined nutritional recommendations based on clinical
guidelines for the prevention of diet induced  chronic diseases  Alzheimer s disease  AD  is the leading
cause of dementia in the U S   the  th leading cause of mortality and a major cost to the nation  families
and caregivers  This phase I proposal is for the development of a mobile tool that will deliver
personalized nutrition and meal plans based on genetic risk in order to mitigate AD risk 
Aim    Develop a systematic process to identify specific dietary and nutritional components
associated with AD  Using the      Genomes Phase   database and nutritional analyses of the
traditional diets that correspond with the    populations  we will analyze whether specific nutrients
correlate with the frequency of genetic variants that predispose risk of AD  We hypothesize that a
population s fitness would be enhanced and AD risk would be lower when the genetic variants that are
selected for in a given population are in equilibrium with a diet that is enriched or depleted with the
correlated nutrient s   We will develop statistical models that will quantify these relationships 
Aim    Translate nutritional patterns to a set of quantitative recommendations for AD prevention 
With the nutrient data we obtain from Aim    combined with other evidence based nutrition guidelines
for AD  we will synthesize a set of qualitative and quantitative nutritional  rules  based on the app user s
genotypes  family history of AD and other health conditions  These genotype  and or phenotype  
specific rules will estimate ideal ranges for a given nutrient and amend the conventional  rules   i e 
nutritional recommendations  by the           Dietary Guidelines for America 
Aim    Mobile app for delivery of personalized meal plan for the prevention of AD  This mobile
application is designed for guided  proactive and self executed prevention of AD  and targeted at those
who are at elevated risk  We propose developing machine learning algorithms to create meal plans that
employ the modified nutrient ranges  from Aims   and    for a given AD risk genotype  Users will be able
to modify food preference parameters  for example   vegetarian   while maintaining the appropriate
nutrient ranges 
A key outcome of this project will be a platform that supports population wide dietary intervention by
seamlessly connecting preventive healthcare with daily life in the digital age Alzheimer s disease is the most common form of dementia in the US with over   million people suffering
from this neurodegenerative disease  Aside from those actually suffering with Alzheimer s  this devastating disease takes an enormous toll on families and caregivers and is estimated to cost over $   
billion in the US alone  The exact cause of Alzheimer s disease is still being studied but there is a significant genetic component  with APOE alleles most strongly predictive  Nonetheless  diet and lifestyle interventions have been shown to mitigate Alzheimer s risk even in those with APOE risk allele s   Alzheimer s pathology begins decades before symptoms appear and therefore making dietary and lifestyle changes earlier in life would be a cost effective means of preventing disease later in life  This proposal aims to develop a low cost  evidence based  mobile app that delivers personalized nutritional recommendations in the form of meal plans to those with genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease
