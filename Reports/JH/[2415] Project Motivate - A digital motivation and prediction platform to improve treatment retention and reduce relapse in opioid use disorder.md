Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder
=======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are
needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD)
treatment retention by assessing someoneâ€™s risk of early departure from treatment. Current
methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an
individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late.
Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize
OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose
episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate
sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment.
This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively
support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination
rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk
of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood
that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening
symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment
retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs,
municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace
productivity and costs to families.
