Multiplayer Serious Game for Anti-Submarine Warfare Sonar Operator Training
===========================================================================

# Abstract


Sonalysts proposes to develop PING!, a fun and engaging browser-based serious game for team Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW) at sea and on shore training that targets AN/SQQ-89A(V) sonar operators with progressively challenging tactical scenarios. As teams compete for the best scores, they can focus on proficiencies in which they need the most work, based on integration with the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) that tracks their progress and helps customize training. Drawing upon Sonalystsâ€™ experience developing undersea combat games (such as Dangerous Waters) and creating sonar operator training for the Navy, PING! will include features that let players customize training scenarios and use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to train when individual or partial team training is desired. Sailors can play anytime to improve their skills.
