============================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    It is estimated that the cost in the US for brain disorders per year is $    billion for treatment and long term care  with another $    billion in other nonmedical costs  As a consequence  reducing the burden of human brain disorders is a key focus of the NIH BRAIN Initiative  with one strategy being the use of fMRI connectomes to study brain region functioning  Current approaches for analyzing connectomes use andapos off the shelfandapos  statistical methods not optimized for this type of data  In this Direct to Phase II SBIR we propose
to further develop and strengthen our graphical object oriented data analysis software to solve data analysis  experimental design  and hypothesis testing problems in translational neuroscience  Product  This SBIR will produce analytical software for fMRI data in translational research  Users will access the software through a cloud based Software as a Service  SaaS  contract  The technical innovation of this SBIR statistical software designed specifically and optimized for fMRI brain imaging data is to support moving fMRI technology from basic Randamp D to translational clinical science  The impact of this technology are tools to improve brain imaging experimental design  improve biostatistical analysis of brain imaging data  and ultimately improve discovery of biomarkers and identify possible drug targets for clinical treatment  Long term goal  Extending our cloud based Software as a Service  SaaS  data analytics platform offers researchers an easy to use web based interface for analyzing new and complex biomedical research data  As a platform technology  there are many applications in other areas of biomedical research that can be developed  Therefore  our business strategy is to identify the areas of science that have the greatest potential to make the move from the university research setting into the commercial arena  and that produce novel or complex data with no commercial analytics tools for translational clinical trials yet on the market  The Specific Aims of this SBIR
Direct to Phase II project are   Aim    Develop statistical algorithms and software   Aim    Validate the methods   Aim    Apply the methods to real data  Expected outcomes  Validated statistical software proven to be more powerful than existing methods for analyzing fMRI connectome data in translational research PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Brain imaging is seen as a new way to discover andapos biomarkersandapos  that might be used in the clinic to diagnose diseases like Alzheimerandapos s or Parkinsonandapos s early  and a new way to help develop drugs for these types of diseases  This project is creating statistical software that will help researchers find and test these biomarkers  and speed up the development of new treatments
