(1) Rapid Response System for Deployable and Distributed Platforms (R2-D2)
==========================================================================

# Abstract


Mimyr's Rapid Response system for Deployable and Distributed platforms (R2-D2) is proposed to meet the Navy's need for versatile and rapid deployment of small UxS at point-of-use. This system blends additive manufacturing and automation techniques to quickly produce modular frame components for unmanned aerial platforms. R2-D2 provides this reliable, on-demand manufacturing of unmanned systems in two ways. The first is through a fabrication process that leverages additive manufacturing to embed assembly hardware, wiring, flight components, and electronics directly into the chassis parts during manufacture. This design greatly reduces assembly difficulty and time. The second method to provide agile manufacturing is with robotics and automation to enable R2-D2 to run continuously and unmanned to yield functional drones in the shortest amount of time. Logistically, R2-D2 requires that only a standalone, small-footprint, mobile industrial system and raw materials to be shipped to the area of the emergency event. This greatly simplifies deployment in contrast to premade unmanned platform products that are fully built before shipping. These premade products require assembly, proper packaging, and then shipment to the point of need, all adding time and reducing the ability for first responders to adapt to changing conditions. R2-D2 streamlines this process and mitigates the logistical overhead and cost required to ship a premade drone swarm to another location. This proposed solution provides a path towards providing the Navy with attritable unmanned platforms for a variety of uses. The core concepts explored with R2-D2 also support a variety of military technology focus areas including artificial intelligence, microelectronics, and autonomy.
