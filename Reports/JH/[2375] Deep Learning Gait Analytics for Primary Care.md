=============================================

# Abstract


Alzheimerandapos s diseaseADis the most common cause of dementia and is the third leading cause of death in
older adults in the USOvermillion Americans agedand older live with AD and this number is
expected to climb to nearlymillion byHoweverfewer thanof individuals with AD have
been diagnosedand patients who have the condition are unlikely to receive a full diagnostic workup to
identify the cause sof their impairmentDetection of functional markers is an essential first step toward
prevention and early diagnosis of MCIAlzheimerandapos s DiseaseADand related dementiasRecentlyseveral highly regarded clinical aging studies have demonstrated that subtle changes in gait are
earlysensitive and specificnoninvasive risk markers for both cognitive decline and fall riskThe majority
of these clinical investigations have used an instrumented mat systeme gthe GaitRite systemthat
measures spatio temporal gait parameters from footfallsAlthough the literature is consistent about the potential for spatio temporal footfall based metrics as a
predictor of MCI and dementiathe technology industry has not delivered an accurate yet affordable
solution appropriate for widespread use in a primary care settingA new and novel approach is required to
transfer the significant clinical research findings to clinical practiceThe goal of this SBIR is to create an accuratelow costsimple to use primary care clinical screening tool
for MCI and dementia and a risk assessment and stratification tool for older adults with normal cognitionThis will be accomplished by commercializing recent research in novel software based deep learning
marker less motion capture and advanced kinematic analysis methodsA secure mobile application and
cloud based big data analytics platform delivers this Software as a Service to providers with the low cost
and ease of use required to accelerate adoptionThis new approach applies deep learning technology to measure footfall based gait parametersIt can
replicate the level of precision and accuracy of expensiveandgt $and space consuming electronic mats
used in previous research studiesIn additionour work will significantly advance the research field by
simultaneously measuringfrom the same video streamaccurateD joint angleswhich have recently been
shown to be even more specific markers of neurodegeneration compared to footfall parametersLong Term GoalAll patients will routinely have equal access to advanced gait analytics in primary care
practicesBy providing a consistent methodologyincluding integration in the Medicare Annual Wellness
Visitvery large population data will be collected and analyzed to provide new insights into early stages of
