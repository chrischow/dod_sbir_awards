Synching MINERVA Wargaming with Real-World Navy Operations
==========================================================

# Abstract


Accelerating the operational tempo of missions is an ongoing, continuing pursuit of U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps command staffs.  Currently, the development of mission plans through the Navy’s Mission Planning Process is predominantly manual, tedious and time consuming, often taking days or weeks depending on the complexity and scale of the mission.  Dynamic re-planning in response to evolving conditions during mission execution is even more challenging, often forcing commanders to make sub-optimal decisions based on incomplete information and timelines that are too tight to evaluate every possible Course of Action (COA) alternative.  The MINERVA Innovative Naval Prototype program is addressing these limitations through the development of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools that will dramatically improve the quality and speed of mission planning processes.  However, while the MINERVA program holds great promise for achieving these objectives, there exists a significant chasm between the way machines and Naval staffs interpret information and express COAs.  This is a roadblock that must be overcome before the potential of ML/AI technologies can be fully exploited.   To address this challenge, Moebius Solutions proposes the AI Learned Interaction with Gaming Networks (AI-LIGN) system that will enable effective, confident collaboration between Navy command staffs and the AI capabilities of MINERVA.
