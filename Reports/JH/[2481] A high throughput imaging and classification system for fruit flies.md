A high throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies
===================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY   ABSTRACT
In this Phase I SBIR application  FlySorter proposes to development a high throughput imaging and
classification system to aid research with fruit flies  a widely used model organism relevant to both basic
science as well as studies in human health 
The use of animal model systems is essential for research in almost all aspects of biology  genetics 
development  neuroscience  disease  physiology  and beyond  The fruit fly   Drosophila melanogaster   is
small and easy to care for  but is complex enough an organism to provide a wealth of information that directly
relates to human biology and health  Over     of human diseases with a genetic basis  including depression 
alcoholism  certain forms of cancer  and many more  are either present or have an analog in Drosophila 
Modern genetic tools  such as CRISPR cas   allow the creation of transgenic flies that provide the opportunity
to study diseases  pathways and systems that don t exist naturally in Drosophila  With these advances  fruit
flies are becoming more frequently subjects for drugs screens 
For all the advances in the biological tools and techniques applicable to flies  however  the limiting factor in
many experiments is the manual labor involved in a few common tasks  moving flies from vial to vial or other
lab equipment  classifying and sorting flies by sex  eye color and other phenotypes  and collecting virgin female
flies before they mate so that they can be used in controlled crosses  etc 
FlySorter s patent pending fly dispensing mechanism can reliably deliver a single organism from a vial
containing hundreds of awake flies  and our novel FlyPlate system allows storage of individual flies in custom
   well plates  FlySorter s robotic fly handling system  co developed with the de Bivort Lab at Harvard  is
capable of manipulating and transporting those individual flies between vial     well plate  and experimental
apparatus  The next piece of the automation puzzle to solve is high throughput imaging and classification 
To accomplish this goal  FlySorter will     complete a prototype automated image capture hardware system    
adapt state of the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for use on Drosophila  and    build a
module that can physically sort the classified flies into different vials 
Once integrated into the existing FlySorter product ecosystem  this imaging and classification module will
greatly expand the kinds of experiments and screens that can be automated  allowing for the study of larger
populations or a wider variety of flies  reducing the impact of human error  and freeing up valuable time for
researchers PROJECT NARRATIVE
Fruit flies   Drosophila melanogaster   are one of the most widely used model organisms in biology  for
research in genetics  development  neuroscience  disease  and much more  One of the most common tasks in
Drosophila labs is sorting flies by various markers and phenotypes using a microscope and paintbrush 
FlySorter aims to build an automated system for sorting flies using high resolution digital cameras and modern
computer vision algorithms  which will obviate the need for such tedious manual labor
