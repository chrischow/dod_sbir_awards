# Abstract


ABSTRACT
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS  is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of brain and spinal cord motor
neurons  Since Riluzole was approved in       over    late phase clinical trials have failed and no additional
medications have been approved for ALS  While death from ALS averages   to   years from onset of
symptoms  disease progression displays wide heterogeneity  A typical year long clinical trial can have    to
    of the patients die from the disease while another similar percentage progresses very slowly if at all 
Several meta analyses of ALS trial data indicate that ALS clinical trials are prone to statistical uncertainty and
would benefit from tools that increase statistical sensitivity  It is clear that current statistical tools are
inadequate to address the drug development challenges posed by this disease and many other diseases that
characteristically exhibit high heterogeneity in disease progression 
Using the recently available ALS PRO ACT data set  our team was recently declared a winner of the DREAM
Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize Life Challenge  Since the contest  we have significantly improved the
algorithm  built several additional models and begun to create drug development tools  The goal of this grant is
to validate our clinical trial randomization tool and develop a prototype interface for use and testing at clinical
trial sites  This prototype will serve as a platform for building a suite of tools based on disease progression
predictions of individual patients that will eventually be used for drug development in multiple indications 
The key innovation of this work  as it applies to randomizing patients for inclusion in different arms of a clinical
trial is that it stratifies patients not by a set of features at the beginning of a trial  but rather by predicted
outcome at the end of the trial as if patients in the treatment arm had not received the intervention being
tested  An improved trial arm balance will provide a better test of the efficacy of the intervention 
This work will focus on the following Specific Aims 
Aim    Demonstrate that  compared to traditional randomization strata  randomization strata defined by
predictive algorithms significantly improve the balance of outcome features at the end of a trial period 
Aim    Work with our clinical partner to develop a prototype platform that will enable an ALS predictive
algorithm to be used by on site investigators for randomization in future clinical trials 
The randomization tool is the first in a series of planned tools based on patient level disease progression
predictions  These tools will radically change the way early ALS clinical trials are enrolled  simulated and
analyzed and will enable the development of similar tools  not only for other neurodegenerative diseases such
as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s  but also for multiple other diseases including diabetes  hospital acquired
infections  heart disease and cancer NARRATIVE
This work will develop a prototype to test the use of patient disease progression predictions made by machine
learning models as a new way of randomizing clinical trials  The prototype will serve as a platform for the
inclusion of a range of drug development tools based on individual patient predictions
