# Abstract


One of the main requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act is that eligible students be
provided supplemental tutoring. Many states have already implemented their own initiatives; however, there is significant concern over whether it will be realistic to help as many students as possible in a cost-effective way. This SBIR Phase I project is responsive to the goals of evidence-driven consulting services for schools, and education data management services for constructing classroom profiles of student performance to enhance student achievement. The focus of this work is the investigation and development of a methodology for creating SCORMconformant  intelligent tutoring systems that are conformant with the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiativeâ€™s SCORM model for reusable, interoperable e-learning resources. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), which use artificial intelligence to generate individually tailored realtime instruction, hold a central position in the SCORM vision. These systems offer much greater depth, breadth and sophistication of interaction with the learner than conventional computerbased instruction software. The prospect of highly reusable and interoperable ITS learning objects is extremely attractive. The ability to give all students on-demand access to  highpowered instructional services is tremendously desirable, particularly for those in greatest need by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instruction.
