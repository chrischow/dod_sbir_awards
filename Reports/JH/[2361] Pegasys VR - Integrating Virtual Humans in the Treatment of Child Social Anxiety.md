===============================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth  with lifetime prevalence ranging between        of the general population  Among anxiety disorders  social anxiety disorder  SAD  affects    of all youth  resulting in significant short and long term impairment  including increased likelihood of substance abuse  limited academic achievement  attenuated occupational functioning  and impaired or missing social relationships  Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training  formal peer generalization sessions  and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components   the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization  Two critical treatment elements  peer generalization  homework assignments  are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings  limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings  e g   at school  outpatient  or community facilities   In our recenly completed Phase I STTR  we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment  VE  to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization  Our VE  known as Pegasys VRandquot   allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities  in clinic solution  or intensive parental involvement  at home solution   Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET C program was accessible  credible and feasible for the parents  clinicians and children who participated in the trial  Furthermore  examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms  Given the success of the Phase I  and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth  our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals  incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system  develop additional VEs for in clinic practice  expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in vivo settings  using serious game theory and technology  and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages   to    to test whether Pegasys VRandquot  is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at   month follow up  If Pegasys VRandquot  is clinically efficacious  it would offer a sustainable  cost effective intervention that can be easily and rapidy disseminated PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Among children  social anxiety is a common  severe and chronic disorder  Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children  SET C  is an empirically supported treatment with significant potential to impact the lives of children with this severe and chronic disorder  The proposed Pegasys VRandquot  system will distinctly enhance its utility  as it will allow dissemination to a broad variety of clinical settings including schools as well as traditional outpatient clinics  Its use for the treatment of social skills deficits will offer a superior soluton for mental health personnel  solving many of the resource and logistic barriers that they currently face  The final product will address cost and practical issues by disseminating an empirically supported treatment that was rigorously built and tested  Using VE will make the traditional social skills therapy programs program cost effective and patient centric  allowing even clinicians with little background training in behavior therapy to have tools not typically availabl to them
