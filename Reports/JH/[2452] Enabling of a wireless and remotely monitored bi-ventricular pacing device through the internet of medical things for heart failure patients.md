Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients
============================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves
for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)
biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors.
Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States
with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home
monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes
and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to
remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body.
Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic
waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves
and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled
to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram
other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and
communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet.
An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using
continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions
individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote
monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements
using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy
transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo
experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and
energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure
data.
This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal
is to successfully translate the Bionet’s system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be
applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal
patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care.Project Narrative
Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing devices will be developed using new
core technology for the internet of medical things. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to allow
communication between the different implantable elements and recharge those same elements allowing for
miniaturization. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of the heart
failure patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.
