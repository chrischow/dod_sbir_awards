NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION- Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
=======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Consistent with the Navy objective, Oceanit is working from foundations in cognitive science, philosophy, and themathematics of computability theory to create anthronoetic AI (a.k.a. strong AI): human-level/human-style AIcapacitated with the linguistic competence to generate causal explanatory models via the Popperian philosophy of critical rationalism: given a set of big or small data, Oceanit’s AI—named NoME (the noetic mathematical engine)—constructs a Chomskyan “grammar” (i.e., explicit theories/programs) to model causal relations, thereby transcending (but obviously including) descriptions that answer what is being observed, transforming data into evidence for/against conjectured explanations that answer why and how the data—or, to be precise, the phenomena underlying the data—exist and behave.
