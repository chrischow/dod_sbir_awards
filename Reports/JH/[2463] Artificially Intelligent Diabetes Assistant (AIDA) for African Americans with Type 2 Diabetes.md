# Abstract


PROJECT ABSTRACT
Diabetesa chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and mortalityis disproportionately represented in
African AmericansDiabetes self management education and supportDSME Sis crucial to delaying or preventing
disease progressionhoweverlack of access to proper healthcare due to financialculturalknowledgegeographicor physical barriers places this disadvantaged population at further risk for poor disease outcomesMobile healthmHealthtechnologies have shown promise in improving health outcomesbut have important limitations for
management of this complex diseaseFor examplethey can lack personalization to usersculturalhealthand
educational needsSome technologieslike app and wearablesrequire high self motivationhealth literacyand
knowledge for successful utilizationMoreovermost technological solutions do not support the patient provider
collaboration critical to sustained behavioral change and ongoing diabetes care over a lifetimeWe propose to build
an artificially intelligent diabetes assistantAIDAa chatbot powered telehealth platform that is designed to provide
highly interactiveautomated diabetes self care support and facilitate remote patient provider collaborationThrough
dynamicinstant messaging based conversationsAIDA will provide interpretive feedback of blood glucose levelsconduct assessmentse gmedication adherencemoodand deliver real timeculturally sensitive interventions
using smartphone technologyAI technology will enable increasingly targetedindividualized interventionsIntegration into a larger communication platform will allow providers to remotely assessmonitorand intervene
using real time patient data collected by the chabotAIDA will be a low costsmart phone basedecologically
relevant tool that is highly innovativeengagingand impactfulThis research will be conducted in collaboration
with urban based community clinics and University of North Carolina researchers specializing in diabeteshealth
disparitiesAfrican American populationtelehealthand behavioral change interventionsIn this Phase I SBIR
projectwe will address the following specific aimsConduct focus groups and interviews with African American
diabetes patientstheir caregiversand diabetes care providers to collect input on system featuresusability designand messaging contentDevelop three AIDA health modulesglucose monitoringmedication adherencehealthy
copingand a virtual health libraryandExamine the feasibility and acceptability of the new technologyA future
Phase II application will build on Phase I success by creating additional health modulesnutritionexerciseand risk
managementand conducting a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of traditional DSME S to AIDA support on health
and disease outcomesWe envision that AIDA will be marketed to diabetes care providerswith revenue generated
through licensing feesIf found effectiveAIDA could be deployed across the national network of diabetes
providers programspotentially improving health equity in diabetes care
