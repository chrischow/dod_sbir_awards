Low Power, Portable (Podable) Rapid Processing of High Sample-Rate In-Phase Quadrature (IQ) Data
================================================================================================

# Abstract


The proposed solution to this challenge to increase the IQ data management and processing of advanced wideband data in a modular Software Defined Electronic Warfare (SDEW) architecture with ultra-high bandwidth IQ data transport for distribution to multiple parallel processing elements for both traditional RADAR signal processing detection algorithms, raw IQ data capture, and the emerging potential of evolving Machine Learning (ML) prediction algorithms.
