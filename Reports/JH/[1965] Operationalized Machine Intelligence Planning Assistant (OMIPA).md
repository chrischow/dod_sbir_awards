Operationalized Machine Intelligence Planning Assistant (OMIPA)
===============================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is to develop an innovative Operationalized Machine Intelligence Planning Assistant (OMIPA) system for next generation mission planning. The goal of the OMIPA system is to revolutionize the air mission and strike planning process through the application of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mission and strike planning is a difficult and time-consuming process. Given a variety of mission objectives, the space of possible mission plans to achieve those objectives is too large for human planners to exhaustively explore. OMIPA will revolutionize the mission and strike planning process through the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Technically, OMIPA will feature adaptations of cutting edge AI techniques, including case based analysis, semi-supervised learning, adversarial RL training of neural networks, Monte Carlo tree search, and evolutionary computation. These techniques will help human planners create better, highly robust plans more quickly and reliably for a range of missions; they have been chosen to avoid the technical challenges described above. Powerful ML and AI algorithms will drive OMIPAs ability to generate actionable insights in the mission planning process, but it is our staged approach to the development and implementation of OMIPA that will be the key to system success,
