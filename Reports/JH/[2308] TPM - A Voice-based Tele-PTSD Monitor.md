TPM: A Voice-based Tele-PTSD Monitor
====================================

# Abstract


In the initial SBIR Phase II, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) developed a voice-based Tele-PTSD Monitor (TPM) system to remotely screen, monitor, and provide assistance to clinicians in assessing a PTSD patients condition. ListEn is the brain of TPM system. It processes the voice data, extracts different types of salient features, and computes PTSD scores based on state-of-art machine learning algorithms. The ListEn only relies on voice to perform remote PTSD monitoring and does not require costly video conferencing facility or cumbersome physiological sensors  Here IAI proposes a second SBIR Phase II (Phase II-2) research effort to further improve the voice-based PTSD assessment technique by incorporating the latest machine learning algorithms and conduct a large scale validation with the voice data from 200 test subjects. The voice data will be collected by researchers from the National Center for Veterans from over 200 participants at Fort Carson, CO, 100 diagnosed with PTSD and 100 control participants, all male with mean age in the mid-20s, the group with highest risk to PTSD. The outcome of this Phase II will be fully functional ListEn PTSD scoring engine and TPM prototype mobile app for military and civilian applications.
