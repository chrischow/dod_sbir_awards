Timing and Harmonic AI-based Waveform Error Detection (THAWED)
==============================================================

# Abstract


The physics generating timing spurs in a high-speed, low-bit depth analog-to-digital converter will be modeled in a machine learning framework to enable both the prediction of spurs and adaptive removal using an enhancement neural network. The algorithms will be developed in software and optimized for low-latency operation in a digital (FPGA or similar) framework. High-speed implementation of the spur estimation and removal networks will be accomplished in phase 2 of this effort.
