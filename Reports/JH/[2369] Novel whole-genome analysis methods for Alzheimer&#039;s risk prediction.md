# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    Late onset Alzheimerandapos s Disease  LOAD  affects millions of elderly people in the United States  yet there are no well established clinical guidelines for assessing a personandapos s relative risk  Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials  This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in      by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimerandapos s Disease  The recent release of whole genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimerandapos s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model  The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic  First  a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole genome sequence data to discover common SNPs  rare variants  and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes  the specific physiological changes that underlie disease  This will require innovative algorithm and software development  particularly the implementation of multi objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis  Second  the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state of the art machine learning methods  These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk  which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimerandapos s Disease Sequencing Project  Finally  to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model  algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented  Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what  if any  intervention is necessary  When these aims have been completed  Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late onset Alzheimerandapos s Disease  as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics  In Phase II  we will move beyond the ADNI supplied endophenotypes  using image processing and deep learning to infer neuroimaging features most relevant to AD diagnoses  as well as work to validate the predictive models in a larger  more diverse cohort across multiple sites    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   This Phase I SBIR aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for lifetime risk of late onset Alzheimerandapos s Disease to enable early identification
of high risk individuals for participation in clinical trials and regular screening for signs of disease  In pursuit of this goal  the Parabon team will develop algorithms and software to build a novel methodology for the analysis of whole genome sequence data and endophenotype measures from the Alzheimerandapos s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  This project will produce the first clinically relevant risk prediction model for late onset Alzheimerandapos s Disease and a suite of software that can be used for the production of diagnostics for other diseases
