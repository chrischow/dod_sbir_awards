A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device
=====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT
This project will create the first objective measurement toolthe VisBoxfor the vision subtype of concussionVSCThis will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye care professionalfor referral to a vision
specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendationsThe persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life altering situation for affected
individualsand children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co morbidities such as chronic painfatiguedepressionanxietyand learning difficultiesA lack of accessibleobjective vision diagnostics are
critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatmentThe VisBox will be a software product that is
used with the OcuTrackerOculogica s proprietary eye tracking hardware platformThe VisBox will input eye
movement measurements from the OcuTrackercalculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve
function affected during a concussionand use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an
algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this studyThe VisBox will be used by nonvision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussionconvergence
insufficiencyCIaccommodative insufficiencyAIand saccadic dysfunctionSDin underminutesduring
the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosedThe long term goal is to develop an objective assessment
of vision characteristicsthat will enable physicians that are non specialists in vision toscreen for
concussion related vision disordersidentify VSCmake decisions about the necessity of a referral for a
comprehensive vision examinationmonitor the effectiveness of vision treatmentPhase I HypothesisVisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBIrelated vision disorderi eVSCby leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking systemSpecific Aim IGenerate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI related vision disorder inpediatric concussion patientsSpecific Aim IIDevelop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CIAIand SD using OcuTracker dataPlans for Phase IIThe VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective
randomized clinical studyPhase II will be a multi armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy
in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive
to vision therapyCommercial OpportunityVisBox customers are non eye care specialists including neurologistspediatriciansemergency room physicianssports medicine physiciansand concussion specialistsThe total
addressable market is $MassumingM annual scans at $scan needed for concussions in the US
