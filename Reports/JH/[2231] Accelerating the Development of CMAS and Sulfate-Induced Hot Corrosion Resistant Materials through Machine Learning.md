Accelerating the Development of CMAS and Sulfate-Induced Hot Corrosion Resistant Materials through Machine Learning
===================================================================================================================

# Abstract


For decades gas turbines have been a reliable source of propulsion for a variety of marine-based vehicles. Since their adoption as the go-to solution for vehicles requiring a higher power density than conventions diesel engines can produce, they have suffered from corrosion of their alloyed components. Long believed to be the primary source of the corrosion, great efforts have been made to reduce the Na2SO4 and CaSO4 contamination in the fuel sources. Despite recent efforts to reduce sulfur content to near zero levels (
