Web-Based Application for Aircraft Component Fatigue Life Management
====================================================================

# Abstract


In the Phase II effort, TDA is proposing to develop a comprehensive and unified set of tools and methodologies to make reliable assessment of remaining useful fatigue life of aircraft components. A number of related and interconnected state of the art technologies will be utilized and extended to meet the objectives defined for this effort. Big data frameworks running over a cluster of computers will be used to meet the requirements of processing and analyzing the massive amount of logistic and usage data. The framework will handle lower level tasks such as networking, redundancy, computational load sharing, etc., while machine learning algorithms combined with physics based models will be utilized for life assessment studies. The overall maintenance process will be improved by developing blockchain technology based on distributed ledger concept which will store aircraft records securely and exchange sensitive information privately or publicly among a closed group of partners. Natural language processing tools will be developed to read and process aircraft maintenance records in both structured and unstructured formats. A combined RFID tag and QR/2D barcode technology will be developed to support automation of reading and updating of aircraft components installation records and enhance historical maintenance records.
