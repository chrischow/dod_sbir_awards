NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION- Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
=======================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The large volume of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data that is produced can overwhelm analysts, motivating development of automated processing. In recent years, Deep neural networks (DNNs) have produced outstanding results in the image processing domain and are thus attractive candidates for automation of ABS-B processing. The proposed WiseOwl aircraft modeling and behavior analysis tool will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover behavior patterns and detect anomalies of using ADS-B data. The proposed investigation will draw upon the latest work in DNN-based learning, using a hybrid autoencoder and long short-term memory approach to detect anomalous behavior as well as performing a flavor of specific emitter identification to discover potential message spoofing. The WiseOwl system will augment human analysis for enhanced real-time situational awareness and intelligence production.
