# Abstract


HypertensionHTNaffectsmillion Americanswith an annual hospitalization cost of $billion yearClinical trial outcomes of optima BPO BPa clinical reasoning artificial intelligenceAIsystemdetermined
that the success failure of past anti HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O BP predictive
performanceOur objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment
success failurememoryfunction into O BPO BPan innovation of Optima Integrated Healthis functional at
UC San Francisco Medical CenterUCSF MCthe clinical collaborating partnerO BP AI safely optimizes
HTN medication treatment independent of in office visitsIt collects and analyzes current patient health
information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is requiredO BP then alerts the
physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation
actionIn this Phase Iwe propose the development and validation of O BPandapos smemoryby using the principles
of Instance Based LearningIBLKnown for its flexibility and intuitive logicthe IBL theory will be adapted to
enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O BPIt will lead to incorporating the patient responsesuccess failurefrom past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O BP for HTN
medication optimizationClinical resourcese gElectronic Health RecordEHRprovide incomplete patient

validation will position thememoryenhanced O BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximatelypatients with an SBP andgtmmHgpoorly controlledand at high risk for primary or recurrent strokeheart failure or myocardial infarctionOur long term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated
nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressureBPfor the treating physician while
improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costsWe will develop an artificial
processing intelligence that will allow our current productoptima BPto enhance its efficacy evaluation of
candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performanceoptima BP is a decision
