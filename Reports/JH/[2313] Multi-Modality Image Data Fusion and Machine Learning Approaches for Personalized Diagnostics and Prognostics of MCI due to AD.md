Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD
==============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Alzheimer s Disease  AD  is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the
US  More than   million people in the US currently have AD and the direct health care cost is over $   
billion per year  Detection of early phase of AD  namely Mild Cognitive Impairment  MCI   can delay  prevent 
and treat this serious disease  The project will develop a clinically feasible system for Mild Cognitive
Impairment  MCI  diagnostics and prognostics  by integrating multi modality imaging data such as MRI and PET
as well as non imaging data such as clinical assessments  biomarkers  demographics  and genetic information 
This project involves three Aims  In Aim     we will develop the system by designing diagnostic and prognostic
modeling using cross sectionally incomplete multi modality data by multitask learning  Our multitask learning
approach that will simultaneously model multiple related tasks by allowing effective knowledge and data sharing
to jointly estimate the diagnostic prognostic models for each patient cohort  In Aim     we will update diagnostic
and prognostic model using longitudinally incomplete multi modality data by transfer learning  We will integrate
the model of an old domain  e g   the diagnostic prognostic model obtained at an earlier time point  and the data
of a new domain  e g   new data obtained at the a follow up visit   in order to obtain an updated model with better
accuracy  This can take care of incomplete longitudinal data due to patient drop off  because it transfers the old 
domain model not the data  In Aim    we will conduct validation for the proposed models using the MCI
data collected by Alzheimerandapos s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  ADNI  for all phases of AD 
The current project is novel in creating a first of its kind clinically feasible technology for personalized MCI
diagnostics and prognostics as well as in using  multitask learning  and  transfer learning  machine
learning methods for modeling cross sectionally and longitudinally incomplete multi modality data  It is
innovative in using multitask learning to model incomplete cross sectional data  e g   baseline data  and
using transfer learning to model the incomplete longitudinal data Project Narrative
The project will develop a clinically feasible system for Mild Cognitive Impairment  MCI  diagnostics and
prognostics  by integrating multi modality imaging data such as MRI and PET as well as non imaging data such as
clinical assessments  biomarkers  demographics  and genetic information  Successful development of this system
can help overcome several limitations in existing methods  and help address the current and growing public
health concern regarding Alzheimer s Disease  AD  affecting over   millions people in US
