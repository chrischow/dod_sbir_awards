# Abstract


Our objective is to adapt VS Merlot’s Dtangle to create a real-time extensible and evolvable Distributed Common Operational Picture (DCOP) battlespace data model and associated descriptive battlespace data model markup language (DDML) to improve command and control. The Dtangle™ Application provides a unique ability to create a real-time (dynamically) extensible and evolvable applications based on a user defined Domain Specific Languages (DSL) capable of creating unique processes and data models. The real-time capability is enhanced by the vector (pointer) structure of the Dtangle created applications. The vector architecture performs up to five times faster than traditional logic approaches. Dtangle’s unique dynamic capability allows for on-the-fly run-time target application evolution, able to keep up with changing processes and data models. This is a new innovative capability allowing for dynamic updates, extensions, and/or modifications without requirement of extensively rewriting or scrapping previously developed code.  Every decision creates a vector which ties it to the correct procedure to be executed. Dtangle works in concert with its AnyView Modeling capability to create process and data views. While generating C, C++, and Object Pascal in a Windows and Linux environment. An added feature provided by Dtangle is the literal support for application’s evolution using Artificial Intelligence. Whereas most descriptions of Artificial Intelligence are metaphorical, the Dtangle approach is much more literal in its advanced structure. The advanced structure is based on Coherent Object System Architecture (COSA), a unique and powerful architecture that eliminates the complexity of the if-then-else (ITE) code of traditional applications. Schema: Dtangle creates the data model integral to the process model. That is, inherent in the process structure, the data model is quantitively and qualitatively integrated. Dtangle generates all its constituent software structures and component data elements. The user, as the domain expert (AKA – SME), describes the tactical and operational characteristics of all battlespace entities using the Distributed Data Model Markup Language (DDML) of Dtangle. The DDML is in the form of the user’s own terms as a DSL. Using Dtangle, the Distributed Common Operational Picture (DCOP) data model can be included in operational and tactical parameters, maneuvering capabilities, sensors, weapons, and off-board tactical and operational data sources. Dtangle generates C, C++, and Pascal along with the supporting data structures to create an application. The Pascal application will compile with Delphi or Lazarus on Windows or Linux. Dtangle is built using Dtangle. The Dtangle application is being used to create other applications, including robot models, Extract-Translate-Load (ETL) database applications, a DataPress™ application, and a document processing application.
