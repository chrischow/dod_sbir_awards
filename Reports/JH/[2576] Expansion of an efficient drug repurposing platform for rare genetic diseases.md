Expansion of an efficient drug repurposing platform for rare genetic diseases.
==============================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment  Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases  The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis and transcellular resistance measurements  These measurements evaluated using machine learning algorithms to identify relevant and on  target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals  These assays can be simultaneously performed on thousands of rare genetic disease models  In this grant  we specifically propose to   Model       genetic diseases in multiple human cell types using RNAi technology   Identify and prioritize     of these disease models with the most compelling phenotypic changes  according to multi parametric quantification   Utilize these     disease models as the basis of chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates   Validate the    best drug disease combinations using an orthogonal genetic manipulation technique in human cells   Study the best five to ten validated drug disease combinations in relevant animal models  The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that together affect millions of Americans  We will use chemical suppressor screens of known drugs  based on structural and functional changes in cellular disease models  to identify potential therapeutics
for treatment of these diseases
