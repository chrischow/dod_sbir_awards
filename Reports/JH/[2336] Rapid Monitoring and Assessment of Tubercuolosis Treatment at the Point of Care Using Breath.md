# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    Problem and Significance   According to the CDC global statistics  nearly     of the world is infected with Tuberculosis  TB   In          million f peopled infected lived in what is considered a high burden country  Countries such as India  Peru  China  sub Saharan Africa and others have significant regions endemic for TB  particularly among the lower income population  This represents a significant health problem that needs to be addressed  Objective   The objective of this proposal is to characterize and assess a rapid and portable TB treatment monitoring technology based on a solid state TB sensor that detects volatile organic biomarkers  VOBs  given off by the mycobacterium that cause TB  VOBs are typically found in the breath of human beings and have known associations with many chronic and infectious diseases including TB  The following VOBs are associated with TB  methyl phenylacetate  methyl p anisate  methyl nicotinate  and o phenylanisole  Our prior supported research  NSF STTR  has shown that our newly developed sensor is capable of detecting these VOBs associated in a controlled environment  The sensing material is made up of metal functionalized  D TiO  nanotube arrays that bind specific VOBs of interest based on the type of metal present  The readout for the end user is an electronic signal that gives a rapid  yes no answer based on change in current  orders of magnitude change   The sensor is simple to use  completely inorganic requiring no specialized biological reagents for sensing  i e  antibodies  fluorescent tags  etc    has a long shelf life  over    months   uses a simple potentiostat for operation  and is portable   The intended use for this technology is for monitoring TB treatment at the point of care  POC  in a rapid manner to help ascertain if a treatment is working  or help determine if a patient is subject to a drug resistant strain of TB  In addition this sensing platfom integrates a data analytics platform that utilizes the electronics that operate the sensors  smartphone  potentiostat  to collect patient demographics including time and geolocation of the diagnosis to allow health care workers and health departments to map out where TB is located in a population and where it could possibly spread  This type of information in real time could be invaluable to health departments trying to manage a TB outbreak in a particular region   Using VOBs for monitoring TB treatment is an attractive alternative to traditional methods  i e  sputum analysis  clinical symptoms   as it is can be detected using non invasive methods in a rapid manner  Our preliminary results suggest a relationship between levels of VOBs present and if a medication is effective in treating a TB infection  levels appear to reduce in      days after treatment   Ideally if this relationship holds true  physicians could ascertain if a patient has a drug resistant strain of TB by simply measuring VOBs levels after a week of treatment instead of waiting several weeks for cultures results to get back as is currently done  However  VOBs have seen limited use in POC diagnostics settings since current technology  Gas Chromatography Mass Spec  for detection of VOBs is expensive and not suitable for low resource setting field use  The technology presented here is low cost and can be tailored to detect VOBs of interest via specific metal functionalization  and can overcome traditional technological hurdles associated with breath analysis  To further develop this technology or TB treatment monitoring and provide comprehensive data analytics to healthcare workers  the following hypothesis and specific aims must be looked at  Hypothesis    We hypothesize that the levels of VOBs for TB will decrease if drugs used to treat the infection are effective  Hypothesis    We also hypothesize that if the levels of VOBs are not reduced after administering treatment  then this is indicative of multi drug resistant TB  Specific Aim    Determine the analytical validity the TB Breathalyzer device  and determine the sensitivity and specificity of the sensor in reference to the andquot gold standardandquot  used to monitor TB  Hypothesis    We hypothesize an integrated sensor and smartphone package will integrate into the flow of healthcare for physicians and analysis can be done quickly and easily with an intuitive app for operation and data collection  Specific Aim    Integrate sensor into a smartphone package and assess its performance including evaluating the user interface with clinicians to determine how the technology integrates into the flow of health care with physicians  Hypothesis    Integration of the sensor with a smartphone controller will allow healthcare professionals to collect data about patient demographics in real time which could provide important information for health care organization in regards to disease prevalence  location  stage of diseases  and effectiveness of treatment  Specific Aim    Develop methods for real time data collection  analysis  and dissemination of the information for epidemiological tracking      
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Tuberculosis  TB  kills millions of people each year  This proposal will help develop methods for rapidly monitoring TB treatment using metal functionalized TiO  nanotubes that are designed to specifically to sense  electronically  volatile organic biomarkers that are given off in the breath by the mycobacteria that cause TB  In addition this technology will be integrated into a data analytics platform where patient demographic information can be overlaid with information on the effectiveness of patient treatment  This data can be aggregated and mapped  This will provide useful information on the effectiveness of treatment within a population and potentially predict where TB outbreaks may occur
