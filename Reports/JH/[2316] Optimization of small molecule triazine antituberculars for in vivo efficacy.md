Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy
============================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Tuberculosis  TB  is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis  Mtb   This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately     million people per year  while infecting nearly   million  New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best   months in duration  We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials   E           nitrofuran   yl methylene hydrazinyl  N  N  diphenyl       triazine     diamine  JSF            was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in       It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in           While JSF      did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands  a close analog    E  N  N  diisopropyl          nitrofuran   yl methylene hydrazinyl         triazine     diamine  JSF           was reported in      to exhibit in vivo activity  Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS  mouse liver microsomal stability  Caco   cell permeability  and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic  PK  profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic  We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy  in vitro Absorption  Distribution  Metabolism and Excretion  ADME  and in vivo pharmacokinetic  PK  profiles of these early compounds  The Specific Aims of this proposed research are  Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents  Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant whole genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class  Phase I would  therefore  seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target s through
complimentary methods  A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and or biotech pharmaceutical companies PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic  which claims the lives of approximately     million people per year  Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models  We will also probe the potential target s of the triazine series  We will further leverage the exceptional facilities at Rutgers to ultimately lead to a clinical candidate by the end of phas II
