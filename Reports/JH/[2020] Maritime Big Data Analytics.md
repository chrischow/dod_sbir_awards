# Abstract


The success of military operations depends on operator’s ability to consume and assess relevant tactical data. The amount of data available to a P-8A operator is growing exponentially. While this increased volume and variety of data provides more DCL (Detection, Classification and Localization) opportunities, it also increases the risk of cognitive overload for operators. This is especially true for P-8A missions were terabytes of data need to be processed and analyzed. To leverage this data effectively, the Navy needs to deploy innovative “big data” technologies such as data mining, predictive analytics and machine learning. Our proposed DataMap system advances our previous research in Data Mining and Machine Learning while developing new tools aimed at addressing the specific needs of the P-8 aircrew and MOC analysts. DataMap provides data ingestion, harmonization, fusion and predictive analytics. Our approach provides a tiered architecture that leverages advanced open-source toolchains to bring advanced analytics to the P-8A and MOC. Our user interface provides tactically relevant tools for operators so they can quickly find actionable information hidden in PA-8 mission data.
