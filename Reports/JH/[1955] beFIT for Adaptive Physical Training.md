beFIT for Adaptive Physical Training
====================================

# Abstract


This effort will leverage commercial wearable sensors to tailor physical fitness training to increase Marines physical fitness and readiness. Marines are not often given a clear set of protocols for exercises, nor given adequate tools to monitor their fitness levels. Part of this work is to align infantry task demands against physiological measures, then identify a set of devices suitable for maintaining Marines physical fitness state within and across workouts. A dashboard will be customized to meet the needs of Marine Corps fitness standards, and training exercises and strategies will be tailored, using machine learning, to individual Marines.
