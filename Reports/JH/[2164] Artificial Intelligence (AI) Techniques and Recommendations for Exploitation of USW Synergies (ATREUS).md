Artificial Intelligence (AI) Techniques and Recommendations for Exploitation of USW Synergies (ATREUS)
======================================================================================================

# Abstract


In this SBIR project, Daniel H. Wagner Associates, Inc. (DHWA) will develop innovative approaches, techniques, algorithms, and software, referred to in this proposal as Artificial Intelligence (AI) Techniques and Recommendations for Exploitation of USW Synergies (ATREUS).  ATREUS will automatically, efficiently, and effectively support the exchange of relevant TUSW data and information among TUSW air platforms, TUSW aircraft Command and Control (C2) nodes, and TUSW C2 systems; jointly optimize all aircraft and non-aircraft TUSW search operations, and accurately account for aircraft TUSW operations when evaluating overall TUSW search effectiveness.
