# Abstract


The performance of simulations, especially distributed simulations, can be very dependent on certain critical operational factors such as processor loading, available network bandwidth, or aspects of the scenario being represented.  To date, there is nomethod of characterizing the expected performance of a simulation as these conditions vary.  The purpose of this effort is to develop a system that will automatically generate such characterizations.  Once a simulation has been characterized, the systemcan also be used to provide confidence limits on the validity of the representations provided under the specific operating conditions of any simulation run.
