Artificially Intelligent Object with Virtual Presentation of Engineering and Logistics Data
===========================================================================================

# Abstract


The Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) maintains extensive, separate data sets for logistics and engineering in multiple formats which would be more valuable if the data could be integrated and shared to a greater degree.AVNIK Defense Solutions, Inc. proposes, with our subcontract team members Instrumental Sciences, Inc. (ISI) and Engenix, a Concurrent Engineering Logistics Layered Structure (CELLS) concept based on multipe artificial-intelligence technologies of data mining, qualitative reasoning, and machine learning, to support the Navyâ€™s goal of digital transformation. CELLS will employ a network of autonomous cooperative intelligent agents, to extract engineering and field data from disparate sources, including JEDMICS, IETMS and TMAPS, and provide the data as refined information to multiple users, with enhanced Virtual Reality 3D views based on user roles. Primary objectives of the Phase I research are to 1) Determine the feasibility of acquiring and displaying data through a common browser compatible with the current data architecture of NATEC and Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and 2) Demonstrate the feasibility and potential for a resilient intelligent network to rapidly extract, compile, analyze, and present 3D information derived from disparate Navy databases relevant to users across the Naval Aviation Enterprise.
