User driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices
=======================================================================

# Abstract


Hearing aids are the principal tool today for ameliorating age related hearing loss and its
significant social  cognitive and functional costs to patients and society at large 
However  many individuals who are prescribed hearing aids do not use them at all  or
use them only occasionally  Most reasons behind the  hearing aid in the drawer 
phenomenon relate to the characteristics of the sound produced  and could  in theory  be
addressed with the correct signal processing strategy  The problem persists despite the
increased complexity and power of new devices  for three reasons   a  The hearing aid
parameters  as set in the clinic  introduce distortion or render audible many sounds that
the hearing impaired user had become accustomed to not hearing  The novelty is often
so uncomfortable for the user as to discard the device   b  The optimum parameters vary
depending on the listening task and environment  Under some conditions  a device with
parameters designed for a different condition will perform worse than no device at all   c 
The clinical fitting is derived from a non ideal way to assess auditory function  the pure 
tone audiogram   The optimum parameters for the actual impairment may be different
from those of the prescribed fitting 
Although it is true that the physiological mechanisms make it impossible to process
sound so as to completely reverse the effect of sensorineural hearing loss  a device that
delivers some benefit at all times is likely to be used all the time 
The goal is to develop a hearing aid that can adaptively change its parameters to
address the problems above  and will be accomplished with a novel fitting approach that
rapidly presents a number of parameter settings to the user and lets the user guide the
system toward the optimal settings for each listening situation  This requires the
development of machine learning algorithms to effectively search the parameter space
and user interface devices and instructions that are easy for the patient to use  The
focus of this Phase I proposal is the development of the algorithms and the adaptive
user driven fitting program  and to compare the proposed fitting with the traditional
audiogram based fitting across measures of functional hearing  ability to recognize
speech in noise  and subjective preference A hearing aid user is often dissatisfied with the sound quality of their device  despite its
sophistication and adjustment by a trained audiologist  The problem can be mitigated by
letting the user fine tune the device for maximum comfort in everyday use  We will apply
modern machine learning methods to develop a program for efficient user driven fitting
of hearing assistive devices
