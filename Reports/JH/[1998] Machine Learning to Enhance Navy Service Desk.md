Machine Learning to Enhance Navy Service Desk
=============================================

# Abstract


Manada Technology proposes to enhance Navy call center helpdesks by developing and deploying the Call Center Cognitive Cloud (4-C): a comprehensive, automation-focused platform that uses AI and big data methods to facilitate support request resolution. 4-C will reduce helpdesk labor demands and improve the customer experience by automatically providing customers and service desk agents with the information they need, often before they request it. 4-C’s innovative, cloud-based approach uses industry-standard APIs to integrate with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and customer interaction systems currently in use at Navy helpdesks. This allows the system to be deployed without CRM or telephone system migrations, which will reduce implementation time, avoid disruption to business processes, and allow for deployment at nearly any helpdesk. 4-C will be designed to integrate with legacy, contemporary, and future systems, providing trusted algorithms and knowledge bases to numerous call centers across many systems. During Phase I, to measure performance and ensure IA and security compliance, we will deploy 4-C to Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud. This allows for a straightforward migration to AWS Navy Cloud in Phase II or III. By constructing and integrating 4-C with current systems, we will bring tomorrow’s AI technology to today’s call center systems.
