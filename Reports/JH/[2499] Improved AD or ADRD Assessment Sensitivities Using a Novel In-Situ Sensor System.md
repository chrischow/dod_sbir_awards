=============================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary AbstractAccurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD ADRDis fundamental to detectiondiagnosisand characterization of its progression and prescribed treatmentsCurrent assessment techniques typically rely on noncontinuousdiscreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domainsWith significantly larger portions of American s choosing to age in placeany assessment technology must be able to be in situlow costubiquitousand operate without user interfaceautonomousto provide objectivecross domainand continuous daily function measurements and reportingThe primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functionsADLsand IADLsfor persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settingsThis includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment techniqueADCS ADLMachine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinationsSecondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actionsandltsec resolutionforindividuals with AD ADRDLong term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid stage declineThe Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity based energy monitoring and control sensorsdata analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environmentIntelligent power strips and battery based sensors located throughout the home or facilitymonitor real time absolute location of individualscaregiversand devices they interact withCorrelation of high fidelity data allows accurate determination of activitiesattribution to a specific individualmobility measurementand behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL IADL categoriesBirkeland Current is teamed with Texas Aandamp M Center for Population Health and AgingGeorgiaTech Institute for People and TechnologyBaylor Scott and White Division of Gerontologyand multiple home care and assisted care facilitiesin the development of the study approachimplementation plananalytics toolsand applications to aging populations and future intervention studies Project NarrativeThe proposed research would utilize novelubiquitous Internet of Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in situ IADL ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities
