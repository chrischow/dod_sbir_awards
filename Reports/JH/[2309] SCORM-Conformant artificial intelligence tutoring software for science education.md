# Abstract


This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the extension of Quantumâ€™s successful technology for interactive intelligent tutoring to develop powerful new artificial intelligence-based tools for computerized assessment of student work in mathematics. This addresses an important area where there has been clearly articulated teacher demand for advancement. Quantum proposes a new and different approach to assessment, adapting and incorporating new concepts from artificial intelligence. More than just assigning a grade, meaningful opportunities will be created for students to learn directly from the assessment itself. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as lower-performing students and students from historically underrepresented groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality mathematics instruction. The proposed technology will be particularly relevant in helping teachers and administrators meet the goals of NCLB by facilitating construction of classroom profiles of student performance and providing recommendations for enhancing student achievement. In Phase I, feasibility will be established by developing an automated grading program within an existing intelligent tutoring system, that can grade homework and tests in which teachers assign their own problems and students show their own work in detail.
