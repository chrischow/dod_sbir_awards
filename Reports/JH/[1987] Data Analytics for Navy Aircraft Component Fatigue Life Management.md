Data Analytics for Navy Aircraft Component Fatigue Life Management
==================================================================

# Abstract


Many components and structural parts on military aircraft can experience fatigue-induced failure modes, the likelihood of which typically depend on the historical aircraft usage regimes. AVNIK Defense Solutions, Inc. is leading this NAVAIR SBIR project to develop new automated methods for managing fatigue life of aircraft components, considering the actual usage and historical field experience, to reduce maintenance, reduce cost, and improve fleet readiness.Our innovative concept is a software automated analysis toolset system (SAATS) that consists of a resilient intelligent network incorporating cooperative intelligent agents to autonomously acquire usage and maintenance data from original data sources and manage statistical analysis of the data to support maintenance and operations planning. We apply recent technological advances in data analytics to discriminate between useful information and inconsistencies in the acquired data.The SAATS Phase I effort established feasibility of our technical approach, demonstrated key elements of the concepts and techniques, and positioned the SAATS project for a successful Phase II continuation.We propose to conduct principal research, product development, and testing during Phase II, including engineering prototypes of the intelligent network, interfaces with DECKPLATE and other NATEC resources, data analytics algorithms, fatigue life modeling capabilities, and graphical user interfaces.
