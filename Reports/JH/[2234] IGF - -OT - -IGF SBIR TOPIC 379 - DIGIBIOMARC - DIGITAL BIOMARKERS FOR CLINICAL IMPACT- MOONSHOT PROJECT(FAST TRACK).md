==============================================================================================================

# Abstract


The overall objective of this Fast Track SBIR contract project is to develop DigiBioMarCTMDigital BioMarkers for Clinical Impacta scalable and flexible cloud based platform to capture and analyze wearableimplantableor external device dataThis platform also provides an informatics tool for automated data aggregationintegrationand machine learning algorithmsIt is based on the scalable user centered Medable platformwhich implements standardization and normalization of patient generated data to drive health insightsDigiBioMarCTM will compare and combine disparate data streams to understand contextualized patient physiology in real time in order to identify disease and or detect changes in disease health statusIt also will support cohort and clinical studiesparticularly those testing digital biomarkers from wearable sensor technologiesThis Fast Track project will focus on product development with an ultimate aim of a product that improves cancer research data and clinical trialsenhances clinical careand that can be used to engage patients in preventive health behaviors and treatment adherenceThe Phase I goal is to develop a data agnostic DigiBioMarCTM prototype for validation in Phase IIThe PhaseGo No Go decision point to proceed to Phase II will be a working prototype with specified features for further development and validation in Phase II
