5- Trust Artificial Intelligence
================================

# Abstract


In response to the Navyâ€™s solicitation for cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies from innovative small businesses to address counter AI, we propose a novel and trustworthy AI solution named TrustAI. TrustAI has a new model structure and corresponding fast learning algorithms to design a recognizer or classifier based on application requirements. The trained TrustAI structure is transparent and explainable. It can be used to replace DNN, CNN, and other existing neural-network-based machine learning approaches for all military and commercial applications. Furthermore, we propose a new validation and verification method in order to evaluate the performance of AI systems in terms of trustworthy and robustness. TrustAI has the capability to resolve most known counter AI attacks as reported in the solicitation and the literature.
