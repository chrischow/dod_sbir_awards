Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS
========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  represent a major global public health problem  with
an ICU incidence of       and an associated mortality rate of         Early detection of ARDS
is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation  the only therapeutic
intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with
established ARDS  In response to this need  tools that electronically monitor ABG results and
interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically
ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings  Although these
tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS  they fail to detect early stages of disease
progression  prior to full blown ARDS development  in at risk patients 
Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before
wide spread alveolar damage has occurred  enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS
development  Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing
ARDS  the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score  LIPS  and the  early acute lung
injury  score  EALI   Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating
performance with an area under ROC curve  AUC  in the       range  and demonstrate risk
detection early in the course of illness  well in advance of frank respiratory failure 
Our vision is to build on these efforts  and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm
based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories
associated with post exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for
development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of     
We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly
improved by     combined use of highly specific sensitive cognitive explanatory models to help
guide machine learning by reducing  label noise  and identifying specific risk induced trajectories
associated with progression to ARDS     exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not
yet addressed by earlier efforts     use of advanced natural language processing technology to
extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports  and    use of enhanced machine
learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of
nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques Despite advances in critical care medicine  mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome  ARDS  remains high  up to     for severe cases  There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS  current treatment approaches focus on providing
supportive care  Consequently  there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS  The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this
syndrome  enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full blown disease  Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning  machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable ARDS mortality in hospitalized patients
