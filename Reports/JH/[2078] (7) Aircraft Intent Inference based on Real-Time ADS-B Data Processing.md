(7) Aircraft Intent Inference based on Real-Time ADS-B Data Processing
======================================================================

# Abstract


In this Phase I SBIR effort, The Innovation Laboratory, Inc. (TIL) proposes to deliver Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to autonomously characterize aircraft intent based on real-time Automatic Dependent Surveillance â€“ Broadcast (ADS-B) data. In Phase I, dozens of AI behavior models are developed to characterize nominal and anomalous behaviors for piloted aircraft. The behavior models and data will be used to (1) identify apparent air corridors and (2) detect anomalous behavior in support of determining aircraft intent.
