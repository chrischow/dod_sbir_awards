Systems- Agent Design Environment (Sys-ADE)
===========================================

# Abstract


Irregular warfare emphasizes humanitarian efforts as part of “winning the hearts and minds.” Unfortunately, non-government organizations (NGOs) that work on humanitarian efforts tend to be non-technical or not prepared to merge with military standards. The result is inefficient operations and ineffective humanitarian actions. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is pleased to introduce a Software and Systems Engineering-Human System Integration Modeling Methodology, allowing NGOs to work with template driven systems, automatically filling in the gaps for integration with the military. This methodology, called Systems - Agent Design Environment (Sys-ADE), would create human-system integration capability between NGOs and the military without the need of the expert. A visual representation provides the user with a graphical interface such that they can move a conceptual idea into a military engineering template creating a system that is DoD-compliant. Sys-ADE could then be moved into commercial markets where standards-based systems, such as first responder systems, can be integrated across several manufacturers. Sys-ADE utilizes an agent-based framework combined with powerful machine learning and evidential reasoning, creating a tool that will greatly improve irregular warfare operations. And, with our 100th percentile DoD Commercialization Rating, we are also the company most likely to get it into the field.
