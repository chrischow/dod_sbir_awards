Visual Tools and Progressive Automation for Complex Knowledge Management and Decision Support
=============================================================================================

# Abstract


We propose to adapt and automate the processes and technologies associated with evidence based decision support to the Navyproviding a tool that can synthesize current cognitive and learning science knowledge and inform decisions so as to maximize the value gained for each training expenditure. We will develop a plug-play architecture that will allow us to make the best use of emerging technologies, and innovate in three ways. First, the proposed system will automatically translate aggregate evidence into a decision support environment composed of actionable visualizations and infographics. Second, we will employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate information retrieval, data extraction, and knowledge modelingthereby allowing scientists to focus their attention on the aspects of the process where their expertise is indispensable. Third, we will design the proposed system from the start to be adaptive. End users will be able to target new information sources, change research vocabulary, and focus on new research patterns or metrics. Phase I research and development will result in a limited proof-of-concept demonstration as well as a roadmap for a complete prototype implementation and evaluation in Phase II.
