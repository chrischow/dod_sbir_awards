8-NAVY TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION- Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Develop Capabilities and Impact Mission Success
=========================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Jove Sciences Inc. has been developing and testing the multi-INT near real time Advanced Correlator-Navy (ACOR-N) data fusion processor since 2004 to Detect, Track, Classify, and Identify (DTC&I) any contact of interest worldwide, especially those exhibiting Anomalous Behavior (AB). The two tasks proposed here will address “8 - Integration of Automatic Identification System (AIS) Data through AI/ML Applications”. The first task of collecting, storing, and analyzing AIS ship tracks is relatively easy for JOVE using the ACOR-N integrated RAM-dense and cloud computers. In this Phase I task JOVE will track all ships radiating AIS worldwide to build a dynamic estimate of shipping lanes, and related analyses of dynamic shipping lane densities. The second task is to use AI/ML to detect AB, and it is more complex to describe than the first task. To demonstrate detecting AB, one Knowledge-Based Inductive Learning1 (KBIL) Trusted Agent (TA) will be assigned to every commercial ship broadcasting AIS in an Area of Interest in Southern California. The AB detection demonstration will be performed in this AoI to demonstrate the concept feasibility in Phase I. This KBIL AB detection capability can be expanded and applied worldwide in Phase II for AB demonstrations in strategic areas.
