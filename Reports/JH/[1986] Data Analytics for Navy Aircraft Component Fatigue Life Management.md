Data Analytics for Navy Aircraft Component Fatigue Life Management
==================================================================

# Abstract


Operational availability, reliability, and performance of Navy aircraft are key factors in achieving mission success. The Army maintains extensive data sets to document historical and current field experience with in-service aircraft. Engineering, logistics,and maintenance organizations,at all levels, use these data sets as inputs to guide decision processes about engineering and sustainment planning, forecasting supply chain actions, mission planning activities,and maintenance management. AVNIK Defense Solutions, Inc. proposes, with our subcontract team member Instrumental Sciences, Inc. (ISI), and consultant subject matter experts (SMEs), a data analytics concept, Software Automated Analysis Toolset System (SAATS), based on the new technologies of data mining, qualitative reasoning, ML, distributed work environments and CIA architectures. This concept will lead to a resilient network of Cooperative Intelligent Agents to meet PMA-276 H-1 USMC operations, maintenance, and sustainment systemâ€™s needs. Primary objectives of the Phase I research are to 1) Develop techniques to characterize the information content of selected data sets for Phase I evaluation and identify sources of missing and corrupted data. 2) Demonstrate the feasibility and potential for a resilient intelligent network to rapidly extract, compile, analyze, and present to users information derived from disparate Navy databases relevant to usage forecasting and maintenance scheduling.
