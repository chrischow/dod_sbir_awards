Utilization of Affective Computing for Cognitive and Physical Rehabilitation of Victims of Traumatic Brain Injury
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Our Affective Computing Environment-Module(ACE-M) enables new types and levels of effective cognitive and physical rehabilitation of victims of Traumatic Brain Injury.   Our Add-On Modular designs provide the enhancement basis for adding ACE-M to existing and emerging technologies (existing and new rehabilitation-systems, COTS games, serious-games, simulations, virtual reality, etc).   Further, our prior successful R&D and evolution of intuitive modular interfaces makes possible an integrated framework for affective computing components such as FACS based Face-Reader 2.0, cognitive task performance, and physiological monitoring components for Artificial-Intelligence controlled Human-centric intelligent tutoring.  Specifically, ACE-M near-term developments are low-risk based upon opportunistic evolution of our current Internet Based-Rehabilitation(IB-Rehab.com) efforts for OSD to aid TBI recovering warfighters regain “listening-skills”;  Next-Generation Interface Module(NexGEN) efforts for DARPA to aid TBI and Poly-Trauma recovering warfighters mitigate/eliminate phantom limb pain, enable advanced prosthesis-training, and advanced behavior composer enhancements for the OneSAF simulation system; along with adding Game-Interfaces to other existing simulations efforts for the US Army. At least two existing or new cognitive/physical rehabilitation applications will be augmented with our Affective Computing Environment-Module including extending our IB-Rehab products, and new Wii game-based modalities.  ACE-M FDA processes and approvals are envisioned as follow-on efforts to our similar IB-Rehab and NexGEN FDA efforts.
