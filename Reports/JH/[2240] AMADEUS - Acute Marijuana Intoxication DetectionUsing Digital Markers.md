AMADEUS: Acute Marijuana Intoxication DetectionUsing Digital Markers
====================================================================

# Abstract


NIH through NIDA solicits the research and development of digital markers for detection of marijuana intoxication and cognitive impairmentThe goal of this project is to identify the most appropriate among candidate digital markerscognitive and physiologicalto detect driving related impairments due to acute Marijuana use and to develop a system consisting of wearablesa mobile appand accompanying machine learning algorithms that can be used to detect the corresponding impairmentsTo do thisthe ContractorIntelligent Automation IncIAIwill develop a Phase I data acquisition Appwill use it in human studies in collaboration with the SubcontractorOlin Neuropsychiatry Research CenterNRCwill process the collected data and develop a modelThis model will use a subset of the candidate digital markers to detect driving related impairments due to acute Marijuana useThe Contractor will use this model to design a stand alone systemwearablesAppmodelthat can be used for administration of acute Marijuana detection in clinical and law enforcement situationsThe goal in the Phase I study is to develop an initial modeldetermine effect sizes and design a powerful study for Phase II
