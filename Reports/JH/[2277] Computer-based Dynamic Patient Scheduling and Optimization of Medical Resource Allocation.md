=========================================================================================

# Abstract


Vecna proposes to investigate and develop a prototype dynamic priority-based scheduler which applies artificial intelligence and operations research techniques to manage and prioritize patient access to health care in order to minimize time and distant impact on patients and to optimize the allocation of military health care personnel, equipment and facilities resources.  Vecna 's Solution includes the development of a web based application, modifications and incorporation of existing Vecna products, and use of a system architecture that complies with the Military Health System's (MHS) Enterprise Architecture.
