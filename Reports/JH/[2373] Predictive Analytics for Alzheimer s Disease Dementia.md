Predictive Analytics for Alzheimer s Disease Dementia
=====================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY
Increasing geriatric population and patients with multiple chronic conditions have exacerbated the
crisis of a rapid increase in number of Alzheimer s disease  AD  patients  AD is the primary cause
of dementia  and is responsible for over eleven million disability adjusted life years  DALY 
globally  Overwhelming evidence indicates that progression of AD is associated with increased
dependency  resource utilization  and costs of care  The diagnosis of AD and onset of dementia
not only places an emotional burden on patients  but the costs associated with Alzheimer s care
also places substantial financial burden on families  who often must make significant changes in
their economic lifestyles to extend care  To mitigate the health  emotional  and financial burden
associated with AD  we need to identify those at risk long before they develop symptoms of
dementia  Early symptoms of dementia  such as memory impairment  may not be apparent during
the current practice of primary care visits  unless directly assessed or adequately informed 
Hence  it is not surprising that many studies reveal delayed and or undocumented diagnosis of
dementia among primary care providers  To address this critical unmet need  we propose to use
machine learning and advanced predictive analytics and perform retrospective and prospective
analysis of data  including clinical data from existing patient medical records  financial data from
reimbursement claims  and demographic data from population health records to identify clinical 
co morbid  pharmaceutical  environmental  and other variables related to onset and progression
of dementia  The overarching goal of the present study is to develop a comprehensive decision
support tool that would predict cost drivers  outcome measures and trajectory of dementia onset
in AD patients  To achieve our goals  we are working in collaboration with Chris Craver  Senior
Director  Health Data Analytics at Vizient Inc   and Dr  Ronald Petersen  Director of Alzheimer s
Disease Research Center at Mayo Clinic Rochester  We have now curated data from over       
AD patients and         age matched controls to date  and are now proposing to pursue studies
with the following specific aims  Aim     Using descriptive analytics  create an interactive  secure 
web based interface to enable benchmarking of key metrics for AD and AD dementia  including
population health metrics  co morbidities and risk factors  therapeutic drug regimens  and the true
costs of episodes of care  Aim     Develop an electronic health record  EHR  agnostic  HIPAA 
compliant tool for predicting the development of AD dementia  its disease trajectory and
outcomes  medication utilization  total annual cost of care  and any diagnostics or therapeutics to
augment adverse events  Successful completion of studies proposed in this application would
enable physicians and care providers to better understand their AD patients with dementia 
Additionally  product developed through this grant study would benefit key stakeholders in
healthcare market place  including Medicare  Medicaid  commercial insurers  hospitals and health
systems  in addition to AD patients and caregivers NARRATIVE
While Alzheimer s disease  AD  and aging have several common pathogenic events and
underlying risk factors  diagnosis of AD not only affects the patient but also places enormous
emotional and financial burden on families and care providers  There remains an urgent need to
reduce this burden by providing information  in advance  on the course of AD and costs associated
with care  The work proposed in this application seek to address this problem by using advanced
analytics and machine learning techniques  and identifying patients at risk of cognitive decline
and dementia  By empowering physicians  care providers  insurers and health systems with
relevant patient information  we will delineate trajectory of the disease  and help refine the current
guidelines for dementia  Our rationale for such a comprehensive approach is that by augmenting
clinical interventions and reducing inefficient resource consumption  we will advance value based
care
