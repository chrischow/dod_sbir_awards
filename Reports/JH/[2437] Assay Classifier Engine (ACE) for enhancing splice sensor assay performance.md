Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance
===========================================================================

# Abstract


SUMMARYThe goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach based splice sensor
platform by developing a novel multiprobeMPassay design and a companion machine learning based
classification algorithm called assay classifier engineACEImprovement in sensitivity and specificity of the
splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and
distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similaritiesThe aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivityHoweverthis is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factorsThe
underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off target signals generated by competing
molecules present in the sampleIn the field of diagnosticsone of the ways these issues are addressed is to
perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testingWhile individual singe probe assays
might have poor specificity and sensitivitywhen combinedthese assays synergistically improve the sensitivity
and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determinationIn the field of research and drug discoveryresearchers
have employed a multitude of strategiese gsignal amplificationreaction cascadesor sample enrichmentto
improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificitySome of the PCRbased methods have combined both enzyme based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay
determinationHoweverwhen it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitorssuch as
detecting single nucleotide polymorphismDNA methylationRNA modification and alternative splicingthere is
still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methodsIn the past few yearsLucerna has developed Spinach based sensors to detect intractable metabolites
and biomoleculesOne such sensor is the splice sensorwhich is a Spinach based sensor that can generate
fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interestOne of the challenges encountered during
splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low
specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarityTo overcome this
challenge in this proposalwe will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize
the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responsesWe will use data
sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test
samplesFurtherwe will develop a quantitative MP data set and re train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay
signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sampleThis new ACE algorithm will
then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of
the MP assay platform PROJECT NARRATIVEImproved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought after features in assays where there are high similarity
between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundanceTo address
this unmet needwe will develop a fluorescence sensor based multiprobe assay approach and a companion
machine learning based assay classifier engineACEThe ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay
data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced
specificitysensitivityand dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays
