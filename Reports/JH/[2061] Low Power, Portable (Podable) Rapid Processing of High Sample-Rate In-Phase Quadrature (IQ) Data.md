Low Power, Portable (Podable) Rapid Processing of High Sample-Rate In-Phase Quadrature (IQ) Data
================================================================================================

# Abstract


We propose an innovative system to monitor RF spectrum and rapidly process High Sample Rate IQ data in real or near-real time for emitter detection and identification. We base this solution on a compressive sampling front end to generate IQ data with much lower data requirements than a standard Nyquist process coupled with machine learning algorithms designed to be used in lieu of or to augment the standard method of PDW generation and classification. This unique combination of technologies results in a system that offers full compliance with the requirements.
