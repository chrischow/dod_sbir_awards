6 – Business Operations Streamlining System (BOSS)
==================================================

# Abstract


It is immensely difficult to procure the complex systems-of-systems upon which most Navy capabilities depend. Overworked program managers must manage large teams of contractors with limited time, knowledge, and access to details of those contractors’ activities and technologies. There are many potential causes of program problems to be monitored and mitigated. There are likewise many potential consequences of problems, including disruptions that can ripple across related programs.We propose a Business Operations Streamlining System (BOSS) that will apply artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to support program managers by providing three key capabilities: •     Helping to automate the capture and sharing of organized information bearing on the progress of current and past programs, so that program managers can better track, assess, and control their programs, while leveraging others’ past experience.•     Providing just-in-time updates and context, so managers notice, understand, and respond to emerging issues.•     Facilitating insight into knock-on effects of program changes, including both problems and candidate solutions.During Phase I we will develop requirements, use cases, sample scenarios, and performance metrics for BOSS. Building on those, we will refine our BOSS design, develop a Phase I proof-of-concept prototype, and establish a Phase II design and work plan.
