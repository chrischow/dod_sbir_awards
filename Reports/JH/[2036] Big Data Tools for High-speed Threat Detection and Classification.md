Big Data Tools for High-speed Threat Detection and Classification
=================================================================

# Abstract


The Torpedo Defense Functional Segment (TDFS) is a critical component of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship Anti-Submarine Warfare Combat System responsible for surface ship protection against torpedo threats. TDFS uses hull-mounted and towed sonar sensors to detect, classify, and track threat torpedoes, provide evasive maneuver recommendations, and recommend placement of launched countermeasures. Because torpedoes are generally high-speed threats, a quick response is required in order to execute an effective countermeasure action. In cluttered and complex underwater acoustic environments in particular, recognition of torpedo signatures is a very difficult task for any automated solution, and false alarms tend to dominate the detections. In-Depth Engineering, teamed with Alion Science and Technology, propose the Automated Torpedo Acoustic Classifier (ATAC) solution, an acoustic classifier for automated recognition of threat torpedo signatures to be integrated into TDFS. ATAC implements a biomimetic algorithm that generates a unique spectro-temporal feature set for automated acoustic signal classification coupled with a proven machine learning solution based on artificial intelligence solutions developed by Alion for a variety of defense applications.
