Data Analytics Tools for the Automated Logistics Environment (ALE)
==================================================================

# Abstract


The Automated Logistics Environment (ALE) records all bus communications, systems sensors, and built-in test (BIT) data on every E-2D flight. The ALE today does not leverage the full power of the data available. There are several areas where employing the most up-to-date machine learning and data visualization techniques to analyze ALE data could be used to vastly improve readiness.These techniques allow for easy comparisons of performance metrics for an individual aircraft in the context of its recent history; in the context of “peer” aircraft with similar usage and maintenance history; and in the context of the entire fleet of aircraft. Additionally, the BIT data can be transformed to be both more readily understood by humans (e.g., visualizing trends) and machine learning techniques. Finally, the fusion of all sources of data (including text, BIT, and sensor) related to the aircraft allows for a comprehensive view of asset health.
