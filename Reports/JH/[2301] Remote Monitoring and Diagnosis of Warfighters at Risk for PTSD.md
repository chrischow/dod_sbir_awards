Remote Monitoring and Diagnosis of Warfighters at Risk for PTSD
===============================================================

# Abstract


The aims and opportunities of our Virtual-Reality-Assessment-Modules(VRAM) for Remote Monitoring and Diagnosis of Warfighters at Risk for PTSD are based upon A2-T2’s existing remote technologies already developed for OSD and commercial customers.  Specifically, this project provides an ideal opportunity to extend our remote enabled TBI screening assessment and rehabilitation technologies along with entirely new classes of advanced video teleconferencing technologies we are developing under commercial contracts into the PTSD domain. Our extensions and evolutions into the PTSD domains will exploit our easy-to-understand, ease-to-use monitoring, screening, and diagnostic interfaces customized for medical staff uses for assessments of return-to-duty status, affective computing (artificial intelligence dynamic adjustment of task difficulty to the type and level of user), and our current audio/visual assessments built-in to our Internet-Based Rehab prototypes. PTSD-specific parameters are the focus of our scientific and technical efforts. Our multi-modal designs fulfills non-invasive tools requirements associated with providing important information regarding a warfighter’s mental health status through detection and monitoring of biological patterns and/or signals (e.g. based on normal phone conversations and video-teleconferences) includes advanced hearing and listening screening and diagnoses inclusive of automated audio and/or video cuing, facial emotional monitoring, along with composite diagnostic scoring based upon solid scientific principles.
