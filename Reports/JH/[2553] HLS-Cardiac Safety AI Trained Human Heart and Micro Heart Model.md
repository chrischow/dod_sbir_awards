HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model
===============================================================

# Abstract


HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approachdefined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The
CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high-
throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks fortorsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by
measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived
human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost ofcardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4
million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug inducedarrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical
companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development.
Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived
from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In
addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of
human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool.
To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast-
Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and
CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm oursuccessful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recentlypublished protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this
validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced
changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from
same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an
artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds.
After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac
safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing
any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safetylaboratories or biotech firms.Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety
concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve
productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and
experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor
heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac
safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to
arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments
using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.
