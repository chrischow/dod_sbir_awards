Large Area Maritime Big Data Analytics (LAMBDA)
===============================================

# Abstract


Signal Systems Corporation will develop a Large Area Maritime Big Data Analytics (LAMBDA) system to improve P-8A operator performance by extracting target behaviors that improve P-8A crew tactics. In Phases I and II we will show the feasibility of improved mission performance using LAMBDA installed in TacMobile and provide a laptop system for post SBIR aircraft demonstrations. We will focus on top-down Anti-Submarine Warfare analytics that allow us to improve mission planning and tactics by better understanding the behavior of adversary ships and submarines. Our architecture approach incorporates interfaces with Minotaur, an enhanced track management system for the P-8A. Our analytics include innovative target depth estimation, and large area submarine route prediction.
