Autonomic Knowledge Representation Construction for Software Protection Systems
===============================================================================

# Abstract


Leveraging our current thrust of research into novel modes of computer, this project will focus on characterizing the state of the system using low-level descriptors abstracted with machine learning and processed to identify normal operation from varying levels of suspicious behavior. With this, we will be able to thwart novel attacks, providing a needed and novel security capability.
