A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules
===============================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Primarily due to the lack of physical symptoms in the early stage  lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide  Although high resolution computed tomography  CT  has been proved to be a sensitive  non invasive modality for visualizing small lung nodules  which could be the early manifestation of lung cancer  a considerable number of false positive detections are often resulted  Consequently  additional procedures  such as invasive biopsy   follow up scans  are frequently needed to verify the nature of the indeterminate nodules  The negative effects associated with these over diagnosis procedures  such as biopsy complications  exposure to additional radiation  patient anxiety  and economic cost  significantly limits the efficacy of CT screening for early diagnosis of lung cancer  In this project  we propose to develop a computer model to quantitatively assess the nature of indeterminate nodules using a longitudinal dataset  Unlike available investigations or lung cancer risk models  we will comprehensively quantify a wide variety of properties  features  of a nodule in an unprecedented detailed manner as well as their variations over time  and synergize them with patient demographic information  e g   age  gender  smoke history  using machine learning techniques  Not only the image features of lung nodules but also their spatial relationship with respect to important lung landmarks as well as other smoke related lung abnormalities  e g   emphysema  will be incorporated into this model  The output of this project  namely a novel computer tool  could aid clinicians to more accurately and efficiently assess the nature of indeterminate nodules  ultimately leading to the reduction of unnecessary harm and costs to patients and the healthcare system  All these will significantly improve the efficacy of CT for early lung cancer screening by maintaining its high sensitivity while reducing false positive findings  In terms of commercial potential  the developed tool could be easily integrated with the available image information systems at medical institutions by following the widely adopted Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine  DICOM  standard    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  This project aims to develop a novel computer tool for aiding in accurate assessment of indeterminate nodules  Its novelty lies in the incorporation of a large variety of image features and patient demographic information using machine learning techniques and a longitudinal dataset  The availability of this tool would significantly improve th efficacy of CT by reducing false positive findings while maintaining its high sensitivity
