A wearable device to detect opioid overdose and to prevent death
================================================================

# Abstract


Bioresp TechnologiesIncproposes development of RespiLifea new wearable device to to track
physiologic data for early detection of opioid overdose and to relay data and the generated alerts
to relevant caregivers for further interventionThe goal is to reduce the number opioids related
deaths by early detection of overdoseOpioid epidemic death toll has quadrupled sinceAbout half of those deaths are due to prescription opioids and for the most part are unintentionalRespiLife tracks oxygen saturationrespiratory rateand pulse rate and based on a machine
learning algorithm will determine changes from the baseline and correlation of those changes with
changes in medicationsOur specific aims areProduction of five working prototypes with their
algorithm to use in our validation studyA validation study to compare our data with a
gold standard device and carry out statistical analysis for evaluation of agreement and accuracy Public health relevanceCurrently we in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic that has resulted in a four fold
increase in death rate since
