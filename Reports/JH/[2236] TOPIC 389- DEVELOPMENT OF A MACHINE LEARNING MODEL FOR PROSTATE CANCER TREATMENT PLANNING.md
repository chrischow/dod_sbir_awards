TOPIC 389- DEVELOPMENT OF A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT PLANNING
=========================================================================================

# Abstract


This project s goal is to develop and test an application that uses Artificial IntelligenceAIto improve consistency and quality of RT treatment plans for prostate cancerBy understanding expert planner preferences in structure contouring and treatment planningand combining this rationale with data amassed in NRG clinical trialsAI models will be trained to produce contours and treatment plans achieving consensus amongst experts and optimal quality of life outcomes based on more clinical evidence than any one expert s inputOverallthis project will meet a need for improved treatment planning for prostate cancer at reduced economic costThis AI system will generate treatment plans that will provide a standard which may be compared against those generated by human plannersin timeas teams at individual institutions who employ the product develop greater experience with the systemtheir engagement will foster the achievement of plans at higher quality with lower investment of human capitalthereby improving quality of care while reducing costs
