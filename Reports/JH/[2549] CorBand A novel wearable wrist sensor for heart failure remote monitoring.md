CorBand A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring
=========================================================================

# Abstract


ReThink Medical  Inc  proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it
validated in Phase I  the CorBand  The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are
predictive of cardiac decompensation  to detect the early stages of decompensation  and to relay both the
physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by
enabling proactive preventative care in the heart failure population  Heart failure effects     million individuals
in the US and the costs associated are approaching $   billion annually  This technology will not only improve
the quality of life for heart failure patients  but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare
system  Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay for service healthcare
paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies  Our specific
aims include     manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large  long term  ambulatory
studies  It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices  CIEDs   Heart
rate  HR   heart rate variability  HRV   activity levels  and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be
compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for
correlation      The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients  We will collect
the patientandapos s clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the
CorBand  We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number
of machine learning approaches  In aim      we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients 
All the subjects will wear the CorBand  we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation
events  provide that information to subjectandapos s caregiver in order to provide preventative care  The other half will
receive usual care  We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate
the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and
reducing the associated costs  We will investigate the benefits of a novel  non invasive multi parameter sensor
with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early stage
cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations
