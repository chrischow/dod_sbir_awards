Clinical Data Intelligence and Advanced Analytics to Reduce Drug Diversion across the Care Delivery Cycle and Drug Supply Chain in Health Systems
=================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


This SBIR project will research mechanisms to detect when Health Care Workers  HCWs  in hospitals steal or  divert  legal drugs either to abuse themselves or to illegally sell to others  We focus on HCWs in hospitals because of the alarming rates of substance abuse and diversion in hospitals  with multiple studies finding roughly     of our nation s nurses  anesthesiologists  and pharmacists are currently diverting drugs in their workplaces  HCWs are becoming addicted  destroying their careers  jeopardizing their patients  safety  and increasingly dying from drug diversion overdoses  Diversion continues even though most hospitals already lock p addictive drugs in Automated Dispensing Machines  ADMs   and run monthly  anomalous usage  computer reports to try to detect diversion  Hospitals broadly agree these current methods have two main weaknesses  
    Data in the ADM only show part of the equation  the dispensing of the drug from the locked cabinet  ignoring drug administration data in the Electronic Medical Record  EMR   as well as other data available in other existing hospital computer systems   
    Motivated diverters can game the system with falsified data entries to avoid detection  This SBIR project will conduct research to address these two problems by building a computer system with  a  automated data feeds from multiple existing hospital computer systems and  b  advanced 
analytics to flag potential diversion for investigation  We will test the following four hypotheses  
   Data Consolidation hypotheses and experimentation plan   Phase    If we consolidate data from two systems  EMR andamp  ADM   then we can detect diversion that would have been undetected using data only from the ADM  Hypothesis     Phase    If we consolidate data from five systems  EMR  ADM  Purchasing Systems  Internal Inventory System s   and Employee Time Clocks  then we can detect diversion that would have been undetected using only EMR andamp  ADM data  Hypothesis    
  Data Analytics hypotheses and experimentation plan  Phase    If we create and test algorithms on blinded  consolidated  historical data from EMR ADM  then we can detect known cases of drug diversion that that current methods do not detect  with fewer Type II errors   false negatives     Hypothesis    Phase    If we refine and test additional algorithms using near real time  consolidated data from the five computer systems above  then we can detect drug diversion that current methods do not detect  faster  with fewer Type I errors   false positives   and fewer Type II errors   Hypothesis   This SBIR Phase   project will research mechanisms to detect when Health Care Workers  HCWs  in hospitals steal or  divert  legal drugs either to abuse themselves or to illegally sell to others  Drug diversion is considered a very important and visible public health issue because of its impact on patient safety  In addition  this research has the potential to reduce injuries to HCWs who are becoming addicted  destroying their careers  jeopardizing their patients  safety  and increasingly dying from drug diversion overdoses
