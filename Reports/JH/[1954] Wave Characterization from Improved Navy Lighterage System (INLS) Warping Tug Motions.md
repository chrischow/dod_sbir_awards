Wave Characterization from Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) Warping Tug Motions
=====================================================================================

# Abstract


A method is proposed for the estimation of directional wave spectra using vessel motion measurements, with the only a priori knowledge required being the vessel mass and/or waterplane characteristics. All other relevant vessel characteristics are learned in the field. The method may be extended to eliminate the need for any a priori knowledge whatsoever using machine learning techniques, for situations where training operations can be conducted with moderate quality external wave measurements.
