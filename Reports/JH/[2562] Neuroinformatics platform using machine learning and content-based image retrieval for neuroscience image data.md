Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data
==============================================================================================================

# Abstract


This project aims to develop NeuroManageran innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsingstoringaggregatinganalyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image dataA core technology that we will
develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using SemanticsICARUSa novelintelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by
semantic conceptICARUS will use machine learning applied to content based image retrievalCBIRto build
and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign
semantic concepts to neuroimagesNeuroscience research generates extensivemultifaceted data that is
considerably under utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source labOn the
other handthere are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience researchincluding the
opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved
reproducibility of scientific studies and their resultsUnfortunatelynone of the neuroscience data sharing options
that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientistsTo solve this problemNeuroManager will include the
following distinctsignificant innovationsiversatility for handling two dimensionalDand three dimensional
neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humansiifunctionality to share complex datasets that extends
secureprivacy controlled paradigms from institutionallaboratory based and even public domainsiiiflexibility
to implement NeuroManager within an institute s IT infrastructureor on most cloud based virtualized
environments including AzureGoogle Cloud Services and Amazon Web Servicesivand most importantlythe ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data setsThe benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience
research communitypharmacological and biotechnological Randamp Dand society in general will be to foster
collaboration between scientists and institutionspromoting innovation through combined expertise in an
interdisciplinary atmosphereThis will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology
associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levelsi emacroscopicallymicroscopicallysubcellularly and functionallyultimately leading to an improved basis for
developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseasesIn Phase I we will prove
feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR onD whole slide
images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaboratorsWork in
Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations
mentioned aboveA competing technology with comparable functionalityaddressing the full breadth of needs
for modern neuroscience researchis currently not available commercially or otherwise Narrative
There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience researchincluding the opportunity
for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of
scientific studies and their resultshowever none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill
all the needs of neuroscientistsThis project commercializes an innovative software for sophisticated advanced
parsingstoringaggregatinganalyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image dataincluding a novelintelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable content based neuroscience image search powered by
machine learningthereby opening new horizons in neuroscience research collaborationsThis system will allow
researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasibleultimately providing
the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases
