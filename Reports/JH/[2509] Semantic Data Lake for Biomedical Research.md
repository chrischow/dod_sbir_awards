Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research
==========================================

# Abstract


Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever growing
volume  velocity  and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge  The
development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies  including next
generation genetic sequencing  electronic health records and clinical trials systems  and research data
warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production  This in turn
results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and
interpretation  tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly  integration 
transformation  and analysis of these Big Data sets  In this project  we propose to develop the Semantic
Data Lake for Biomedical Research  SDL BR  system  a cluster computing software environment that
enables rapid data ingestion  multifaceted data modeling  logical and semantic querying and data
transformation  and intelligent resource discovery  SDL BR is based on the idea of a data lake  a
distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data  and that
delays modeling decisions until data is to be used  This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods
for semantic data modeling  integration  and querying  and for resource discovery based on learned
relationships between users and data resources The SDL BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage 
integrate  and make available large institutional data sets to researchers  and that permits users to generate
data models specific to particular applications  It uses state of the art cluster computing  Semantic Web  and
machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion  semantic modeling and querying  and search
and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated  Web based user interface
