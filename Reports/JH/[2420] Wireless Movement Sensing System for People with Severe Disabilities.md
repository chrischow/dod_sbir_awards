Wireless Movement Sensing System for People with Severe Disabilities
====================================================================

# Abstract


Abstract
The ability of people with severe physical impairment to participate in family lifecommunicationworkor recreation is severely restricted without access to assistive technologyATYetas disability severity increasesso does the challenge to findingan access
movement that a person can perform to control AT andan access technology that can detect
the access movementWe propose to create a wireless movement sensing system that can learn a
user s access movement and then recognize that movement in order to wirelessly control
assistive devicesOnce we complete the technology developmentwe will measure the sensitivity
and specificity of our wireless movement sensing system using the movements of ten people
with SPIWe will present our results to AT experts during a focus group session and determine
the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the technologyThis Phaseresearch is proposed by
a multidisciplinary research team consisting of AT engineersAT cliniciansand a machine
learning expert Project Narrative
The proposed movement sensing system adapts to the abilities of people with severe physical
impairment and enables them to better control smart devicese gcomputerssmartphonesetc
