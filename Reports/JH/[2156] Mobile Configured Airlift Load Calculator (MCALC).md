Mobile Configured Airlift Load Calculator (MCALC)
=================================================

# Abstract


Cargo transportation on US Navy and Marine Corps aircraft is complex due to the unique limitations related to aircraft, including the loading space dimensions, the aircraft center of gravity, and restraint requirements. Cougaar Software, Inc. (CSI) proposes developing a Mobile Configured Airlift Load Calculator (MCALC) application – an Artificial Intelligence enhanced software capability has the ability to automate cargo handling operations to obtain dimensional cargo data and generate optimal cargo configurations with tie-down patterns. CSI’s aim is to develop a tool that has (1) a high-performance optimization engine for determining an optimized load configuration, meeting a user-configurable set of constraints and requirements; (2) an innovative image processing algorithm to convert images from a camera into dimensional data measurements of cargo and 3D space; (3) intuitive and simple, lightweight user interfaces designed to allow users to leverage the planning, and execution support of the plan, with little or no training or support; and (4) an open API allowing other programs or systems to access the loading optimization as part of a larger business process, mobile apps, or external planning/support systems. Providing an automated mobile means to evaluate and design cargo configurations will improve the safety of crew members and cargo while expediting the cargo transportation process. Specific features of MCALC will include the ability to: Measure, input, and store unique cargo dimensions using a handheld device’s camera;  Determine the location of tie-down rings and tie-down using innovative image processing; Generate optimal cargo configurations and tie-down patterns across different cargo loading zones and aircraft requirements using optimization algorithms;      Calculate restraint provided by specific tie-down patterns; Evaluate cargo configurations based on user-selected preferences; View load configurations on an interactive 3D visualization that allows users to view each loading step; Save and display known and newly developed cargo configurations based on the aircraft selected; Generate machine-readable and human-readable (e.g., on the UI and/or as PDFs) load steps aircraft cargo loading; Add and save notes/remarks to the application as needed;  View CLG publications and other documents necessary to support duties; Make calculations needed to support airmen;Integrate of capability into MAGTAB The optimization algorithms will include consideration of compliance, constraints, and limitation factors to generate a cargo configuration and tie-down pattern. The MCALC capability will utilize Government-provided cargo and aircraft/container characteristics and restraint restrictions that can be used for planning and optimization reasoners and have the ability to load, unload, and edit the data as appropriate.
