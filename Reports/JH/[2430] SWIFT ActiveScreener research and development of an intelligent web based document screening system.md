# Abstract


Project Summary
More than       systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence 
based medicine  with each review requiring  on average  between six months to one year of effort to complete 
In order to remain accurate  systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication  with most
reviews out of date within five years  In the screening phase of systematic review  researchers use detailed
inclusion exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research
question under consideration  For each article considered  a researcher reads the title and abstract and
evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria  A typical review may require screening thousands
or tens of thousands of articles in this manner  Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer      
seconds  on average  to screen a single abstract  dual screening a set of        abstracts may require between
    to     hours of labor  We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article
prioritization can reduce by more than     the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a
systematic review  Recently  we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web based 
collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT Active Screener 
Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews
conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science  NIEHS  
the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  
The Endocrine Disruption Exchange  TEDX   and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration  EBTC   These
early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback  and we have identified
several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software  Our goal for the current proposal is
to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT Active Screener 
including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success  The research we propose
encompasses three specific aims 
    Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation 
We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address
critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods  Aim     Improved Statistical Models  
    Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing
systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication  Aim     New Methods for
Systematic Review Updates  
    Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of
simultaneous screeners  Aim     Software Engineering for Scalability  Usability and Full Text Extraction  Project Narrative
Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence based medicine and environmental health
research to identify  assess  and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific 
targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus 
By conducting research and development to build a web based  collaborative systematic review software
application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening  we will make an important
contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review 
These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to
maintain  a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety
of medical and health related disciplines having great public significance
