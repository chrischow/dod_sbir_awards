PACT: Personalized Account and Community management Tool
========================================================

# Abstract


Social media platforms have enhanced many communities by facilitating online development of relationships, fostering collaboration, connecting friends and supporting activism. However, these platforms are also environments for people to bully and spread hate. Furthermore, adversaries of the United States and its allies have weaponized social media to spread disinformation. Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) team proposes to develop a Personalized Account and Community management Tool (PACT). This technology will allow users to intelligently filter their feed to improve user experience and mitigate threats. PACT will tag social media accounts on a user’s feed with that account’s interests and personality type so that users can quickly and easily filter off-topic voices. PACT will also detect and mute bots, which will decrease the user’s exposure to disinformation campaigns. Additionally, PACT will identify communities within tagged accounts, which will enable a user to hone in on a particular perspective as well as enhance the analyst’s capability to identify distinct bot-nets. We will also incorporate extractive summarization capabilities that will remove redundant and irrelevant Tweets. For this program, IAI has put together a world-class team consisting of engineers and scientists with expertise in social media analytics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.
