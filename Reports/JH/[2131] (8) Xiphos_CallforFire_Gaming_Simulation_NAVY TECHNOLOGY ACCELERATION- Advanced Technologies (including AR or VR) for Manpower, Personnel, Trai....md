# Abstract


This research and development project will advance the military application of commercial gaming software based Virtual Reality (VR) to maximize overall simulator training value as measured by quality of student learning experience, instructor facilitation capability, Game Based Learning (GBL), and cost. The project will focus on the Joint Fires Observer (JFO)/Call for Fire (CFF) warfighting function by conducting research to determine requirements and alternatives in the creation of a technical plan for a prototype stand alone CFF VR simulation kit. This simulator will be capable of integration into and targeted for the Combined Arms/Fire Support Team (FiST) training environment. Finally, research will leverage the benefits of GBL and gaming software technology, and current learning research, to specifically advance learning value through the practical application of new development. This includes, but not limited to: Full Artificial Intelligence (AI) unit (combatant, non combatant, weapon system) inputs to scenario development, advanced data/metric capture and display and instructor/facilitator autonomy for full gaming effect. The outcome of Phase I will be a feasibility report on the research findings and prototype development plan for the JFO/CFF VR simulation.
