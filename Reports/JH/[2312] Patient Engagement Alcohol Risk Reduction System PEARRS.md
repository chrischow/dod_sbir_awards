Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System PEARRS
=======================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Over a quarter of primary care patients in the United States can be classified as unhealthy drinkers
because their alcohol use conveys a high risk of health and social consequences  Unfortunately  unhealthy
drinking is under recognized in spite of the existence of valid screening tools  Even when unhealthy drinking is
recognized  barriers such as provider discomfort  shortage of time  and stigma can inhibit appropriate care 
 The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a new product to support detection and management
of unhealthy drinking in medical settings  The Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System  PEARRS 
will improve clinical practice by combining existing proprietary software with two novel components  The first
uses modern machine learning techniques and widely available pre existing patient data  such as routine lab
test results  to build an algorithm that will identify patients likely to be unhealthy drinkers  Publicly available
national survey data will be used to develop a prediction model that will then be tested with a clinical data set 
The second component is a data system  database  mobile app and related software  that interacts with the
patient  providing proven behavior change interventions such as goal setting  self monitoring  and feedback 
while simultaneously providing decision support to primary care providers  Iterative software development
approaches will be used to create an app with a simple user interface and reporting functions 
 PEARRS will provide a sophisticated tool for managing unhealthy alcohol use that will enable better quality
of care  treatment outcomes  and cost savings 
 AIM    To develop an algorithm to identify adults at elevated risk for unhealthy drinking
 based on pre existing objective laboratory tests 
 AIM    To develop a prototype data system to actively engage patients and providers and
 support evidence based self guided behavior change 
 PEARRS addresses an unmet need for a low cost method to reduce the clinical  social and financial
burden of unhealthy alcohol use and will improve upon the status quo because laboratory markers will be used
as screeners instead of self report measures that are inconsistently used and can provoke resistance  Further 
PEARRS will relieve providers of the need to perform a task they feel underprepared and unrewarded for 
 The commercial applicability of this technological innovation is high because it is portable and relevant to a
broad market of insurers  employers  accountable care organizations  ACOs  and others at risk for the
consequences of unhealthy alcohol use  The impact PEARRS will have is substantial because it can overcome
known barriers to providing alcohol evaluation and treatment services in general medical settings  PEARRS
represents a fundamental shift in how unhealthy drinking is managed in medical settings PROJECT NARRATIVE
 In some people  alcohol consumption can cause or complicate medical problems  accidents  lost
productivity and crime  Although effective methods exist to identify unhealthy drinkers and help them reduce
their risks  they are not widely used  We propose using routine laboratory data to identify individuals whose
drinking may put them at risk for health problems or complications  and a data system with mobile app to offer
them evidence based behavior change interventions
