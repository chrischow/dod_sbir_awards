SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care
==================================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually
and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent
mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have
inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed
innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patients’ risk level of SUD and a chatbot
to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD
screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and
minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to-
reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR
Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish
this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-
structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators,
insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from
our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare
development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working
prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich,
existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we
will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD
(Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and
conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited
resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered
design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web-
based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD. SUDCare will be designed to
comprehensively support SUD prevention and treatment following an empirically-based protocol through an
enhanced remote screening tool and novel chatbot that delivers follow-up care tailored to the patient’s SUD risk
level.
