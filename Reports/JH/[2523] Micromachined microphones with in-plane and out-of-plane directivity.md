Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity
====================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
We aim to introduce to the hearing assistive device industry directional microphones with high
signal to noise ratio  and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of
acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip  We expect the technology to empower the
signal processing community with a new tool which  when used in conjunction with a
conventional omnidirectional microphone  will facilitate new features like ultra sharp
directionality adaptable in real time by the user and or artificial intelligence algorithms which
scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise  Directional sensing and the ability
to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing
impairments  Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds  while
the threshold of pain remains the same  As such  hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic
range or  window  of detectable sound amplitudes  Directional sensing enables preferentially
amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise 
As the first step  we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically 
inspired  rocking  style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated  robust
piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low power  small size  and high levels of
integration required of the hearing aid industry  Previous work in this field using laboratory
prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically inspired
sensing approach  i e  a simultaneous    dB SNR improvement and   x reduction size
improvement beyond what is achievable with present day hearing aid or MEMS microphones  
By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout  we aim to
accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing
device industry can be made  Further  the proposed readout is better adapted towards
integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip  We aim to integrate a microphone
with both in plane axis of directivity with an out of plane directional design to form a complete
  axis pressure gradient sensor Project Narrative
Studies show that today    of Americans wear a hearing aid  whereas at least     of
Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device  The major reason for this gap is
patient dissatisfaction  Hearing aid wearers suffer from what is known as the  cocktail party 
effect  When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you  noises in the
background are equally amplified   making every scenario sound like a cocktail party  This
research aims to make a positive  long term improvement to hearing aid patient satisfaction by
making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity
