Enhanced Sensor Resource Management Utilizing Bayesian Inference
================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal describes the use of machine learning, data mining and Bayesian inference algorithms for incorporation into a surveillance aircraft cognitive radar system. The need for incorporation of higher-order uncertainty distributions will also be assessed. This will result in enhanced sensor resource management capability for surveillance aircraft radar.
