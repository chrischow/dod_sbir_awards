Cognitive Radar for Maritime/Littoral Surveillance
==================================================

# Abstract


The United States Navy’s radar systems provide essential missions in contested environments spanning from long range air surveillance to air marshalling and weapons queuing. Performance and affordability of these radars is paramount. Performance encompasses the inherent ability to execute the mission and overcoming sophisticated threats and adversarial tactics: technical capability and system availability. Affordability encompasses all elements of life-cycle cost – Total Ownership Cost (TOC): development, acquisition, operation and long-term sustainment expenses. The P-8A based littoral, maritime and land, marshalling and surveillance radar is essential to the Navy’s mission. A Cognitive Airborne Radar for Surveillance (CARS) solution enabled by modern architecture techniques and technologies will advance the capabilities of the P-8A mission through extreme adaptability and justify the cost of a new, advanced system architecture that supports radar with interferometry and Electronic Warfare (EW). Colorado Engineering, Inc. (CEI) developed advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), radar, EW and architecture techniques, along with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies, will be leveraged on CARS.
