Data Link Bottleneck Reduction Using Big Data Analytics
=======================================================

# Abstract


Network centric warfare continues to place increasing demands on line of site (LOS) and beyond line of site (BLOS) data links.  The movement of voice, command and control (C2) and all source sensor data requires a sophisticated network of satellite and in-theater connectivity that includes wideband global satcom (WGS), the common data link (CDL), and low latency tactical data links (e.g., TCDL, Link-16, etc.).  The current and future of USN maritime operations rely on the movement and sharing of sensor data between air, surface and subsurface platforms to construct and maintain a common operational picture (COP).  The data links are operating at or near capacity to move radar and EO/IR data over the network.  The proposed effort will leverage big data analytics and other advance image data processing techniques to dramatically reduce the data link capacity requirements.
