Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery
================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies  a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids  Our goal is aligned with NIDAandapos s intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction  We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines  and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction  The platform we propose to use will help identify  evaluate  and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction  We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia  industry and government  Although there are two first line  varenicline and bupropion  and two second line  clonidine and notriptyline  approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking  about     of smokers are unable to remain abstinent  As an explanation for such low success rate  it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states  which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy  One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity  Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors  either cognitive or emotional  that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse  The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity  potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts  During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on    consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse  rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine  alleviation of withdrawal  relapse  anxiety  depression  cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity      definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and    minimization of animal and throughput costs  During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential  prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence  Finally  this platform  battery  database and computational tools  will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership  created to maintain  support  further develop and publicize the platform  The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA approved gold standards  the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery  the creation of a knowledge database  and the management of the final platform by a private public consortium to ensure maximal quality  value and access  We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies  a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids  Our goal is aligned with NIDAandapos s intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction  We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines  and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction  The platform we propose to use will help identify  evaluate  and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction  We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia  industry and government  The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel  and more effective  smoking cessation medications  We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets  We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery  We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti  smoking medications using the novel screening battery  Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic  We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro cognitive or anxiolytic effects  If successful  this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications  ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in
lost economic output and healthcare costs
