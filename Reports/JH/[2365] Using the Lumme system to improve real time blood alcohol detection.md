Using the Lumme system to improve real time blood alcohol detection
===================================================================

# Abstract


PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is a critical need to develop non invasive technologies to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time 
Such technology would advance research assessing drinking in the natural environment  clinical platforms
intervening in real time  and justice applications  Currently developed technology  transdermal alcohol sensors
 TAS   passively detect alcohol intoxication by continuously testing for alcohol excreted in sweat  While such
technology provides continuous monitoring of alcohol consumption  there are several significant shortcomings
that limit its utility in research and clinical contexts  Limitations include lack of temporal resolution  i e   delay
between drinking and sweat detection   poor sensitivity of drinking episodes that do not meet binge criteria 
and lack of information about drinking topography 
 In response to PAR         we propose to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a TAS
device to improve the detection of real time drinking behavior  The Lumme system combines the use of
existing commercial hardware  smartwatch and smartphone  to assess drinking behavior in real time  The
Lumme system uses inertial measurement units to record the movement of a person s arm in three
dimensional space with accelerometers and gyroscope contained in a smartwatch  Arm movements associated
with drinking are distinctive  and can be accurately captured with a machine learning algorithm  The combined
Lumme TAS system complements one another s strengths by providing detailed drinking data that can be
linked to subsequent increases in blood alcohol content  BAC   The combined system will be able to accurately
track drinking variables of interest to researchers and clinicians  e g   start end of drinking  length of drinking
episode  rate of drinking  activity while drinking  social networks while drinking  location of drinking  and
resulting BAC   Additionally  the gesture data can remotely capture low level drinking episodes that are
undetected by existing TAS systems  We currently have a funded SBIR from NCI to develop and validate a
smoking cessation platform using the Lumme system 
 For the current application  we will propose a Phase I study to establish the feasibility and initial validity of
using the combined Lumme TAS system for tracking alcohol use behavior in real time  We plan to video record
ad libitum drinking behavior in heavy drinkers fitted with both a TAS system  BACtrack Skyn  and our Lumme
system  The data collected in the clinical setting will act as ground truth which will be used to train our machine
learning algorithm that will be sensitive to  i  how drinking gestures may change as blood alcohol levels rise  ii 
how gestures may be affected by type of alcohol and the drinking vessel 
 To our knowledge  the Lumme system would be the first system to remotely detect drinking gestures using
a machine learning algorithm  In addition to improving real time BAC detection technology the Lumme system
could be also developed to deliver just in time interventions for problem drinking PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Alcohol use results in        annual deaths in the US and has an annual economic burden on $    billion 
We are proposing to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a transdermal alcohol sensor device
to improve the detection of real time drinking behavior in non clinical settings
