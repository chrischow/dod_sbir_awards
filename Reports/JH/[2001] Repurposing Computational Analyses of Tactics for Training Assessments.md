Repurposing Computational Analyses of Tactics for Training Assessments
======================================================================

# Abstract


Data generated by external sources needs to be consolidated and processed to derive new training scenarios and to recommend new training objectives and measures of performance. The main technical challenges this solution will address are: data from diverse sources must be pre-processed (i.e., validated, cleaned, synchronized) and loaded into a data warehouse; the central data warehouse must have a flexible, adaptable data structure, able to ingest diverse input data streams and allow manifold analysis and processing; the solution must process this data and generate scenarios, recommended training objectives and measures of performance; and finally the solution must ensure validity of the repurposed data assisting subject matter expertise oversight. Our proposed solution combines proven, current and emerging technologies to provide an innovative and integrated solution for the training community. Selected technological innovations include ontology stores and graph databases (for the data warehouse) and recent artificial intelligence technologies for realizing the knowledge engine solution. Our state-of-the-art Simulation Resource Planning (SRP) Scenario & Training Management (STM) technology is developed specifically to address this issue, making scenario and training management, as well as big data analysis, available to the warfighter whenever and wherever needed.
