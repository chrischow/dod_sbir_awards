# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year       Alzheimerandapos s disease  AD  is the leading cause of dementia  followed by synucleinopathies  such as dementia with Lewy bodies  DLB  and Parkinsonandapos s disease with dementia  PDD   Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies  genetic associations  biomarkers  and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases  there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes  in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process  To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring  ABM  proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes  INSPECDS   The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler  AMP   a recently developed Sleep Profiler  and integrated machine learning  classification algorithms  hosted on a secure  cloud based  infrastructure for automated data processing  analysis  and reporting  The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH funded SBIR Phase I II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea  The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced  electrophysiological measures  e g      channel  wireless EEG and ECG  during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks  This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real time relations between fluctuations in alertness  discrete cognitive functions  and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits  The Sleep Profiler is an FDA cleared  easily applied  wireless EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in home sleep studies  With integrated measures of submental  chin  EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements  the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM sleep behavior disorder  RBD   which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy  Furthermore  the application of sophisticated  machine learning  classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes  The overarching goal of the current  Direct to Phase II  SBIR project is to develop a secure  cloud based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler  train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes  validate diagnostic accuracy  and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud based architecture  Once completed  the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies  genetic associations  clinical course  and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases  there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes  in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process  To address this unmet need  Advanced Brain Monitoring  Carlsbad  CA  is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes  INSPECDS   which will provide an inexpensive  non invasive solution combining neurocognitive  electrophysiological  EEG  ECG  EMG   and sleep behavior assessment into a single  integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms  Once completed  the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in university based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants
