REVAMP: REcommendation, Verification, and Analysis for Mission Planning
=======================================================================

# Abstract


Effective and efficient data-driven mission support is crucial for achieving readiness and superiority in warfighting enterprises. Leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in mission planning would not only minimize the human-error factors and increase accuracy, but also improve speed in planning, execution, and evaluation of a mission. REVAMP will improve the next generation of Mission Planning Systems (MPS) by providing automated mission planning and performance verification capabilities. It will close the gap between state-of-the-art data-based techniques and the currently used mission planning processes to increase reliability and speed, while reducing operational costs and the cognitive burden imposed on planners and pilots. The proposed tool is expected to improve the planning process with the use of AI and ML and benefit the management process particularly in complex tactical operations.
