Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer&#039;s disease environments
====================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian
stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in
nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which
we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated
biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical
input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical
activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting
systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system
and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS.
While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human
health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS
experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian
light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based
lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology,
allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was
confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing
homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting
can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based
lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as
periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to
researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would
be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patientsandapos; CS exposure and could
ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian
systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a
22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the
completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home
applications.Project Narrative
A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these
impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimerandapos;s disease (AD) and
Alzheimerandapos;s-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how
much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products
designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This
project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and
control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.
