Focus Area: 4. Miniaturized End Effectors (Microelectronics)
============================================================

# Abstract


Compass systems Inc. and its team possess the intellectual knowledge base and have sufficient expertise in robotic systems to develop miniaturized end effectors capable of performing maintenance and inspection operations. Our principal investigator has direct knowledge and experience in naval aviation maintenance processes through his past work experience at a fleet readiness center. By leveraging our expertise in research and development, we plan to design a miniaturized end effector for a robotic maintenance platform that will integrate several tasks.  The developed end effectors will be designed to automate the current manual labor intensive maintenance processes.   Upon completion of our design and development efforts, we will be able to provide a feasibility comparison for the robotic maintenance platform and mini-end effectors for existing naval maintenance processes. The concept is to have these advanced maintenance systems augment the current maintainer’s abilities and capacity by applying smart repeatable artificial intelligence technologies. This effort would ultimately increase readiness while decreasing scheduled maintenance downtime for aircraft, ships, ground support equipment and other DoD components.
