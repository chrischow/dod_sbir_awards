Phase II: Maritime Agile Intelligent Data Exploitation Network (MAIDEN)
=======================================================================

# Abstract


Colvin Run Networks will build a prototype of the Maritime Agile Intelligent Data Exploitation Network (MAIDEN) for the large volumes of P-8A data, focusing on post-mission product (PMP) use cases at the ground station, and then extending those capabilities to classified environments including onboard the P-8A aircraft. MAIDEN is built on a scalable and highly flexible analytics architecture supplemented with proven iterative data mining techniques to unlock the potential from large volumes of disparate data. The Phase I project demonstrated Big Data analysis methods leveraging modern cross-source data techniques and the latest data visualization and predictive analytics best practices with a sustainable data management strategy. This Phase II effort delivers a comprehensive justification of investing in the P-8A analytics infrastructure. Modeling focus areas include supervised machine learning and anomaly detection.
