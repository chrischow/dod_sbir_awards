Data Science Driven Aircrew Performance Measurement and Proficiency System
==========================================================================

# Abstract


The objective of this SBIR Phase II is to apply the research that was conducted during SBIR Phase I to develop a software solution that consolidates performance data from multiple sources to ensure that data collection and assessment processes are accurate, efficient, and effective. The solution leverages the processes used by NAVAIRâ€™s Training Analysis Project (TAP) and provides a tool that can be used by both aircrew and data collectors to conduct performance assessment. The design and function of the software adhere to training best practices and align with the performance metrics that TAP has already identified as being critical to mission success in Component Commander plans. Although Phase II will focus on F/A-18 AW and STW, the software is scalable in that it will provide a methodology for the NAE to duplicate the entire TAP process for other platforms and mission sets in a manner that is streamlined and efficient. The software uses Artificial intelligence to enable automated and semi-automated methods for collection of data, assessment of performance, and reporting of training deficiencies. The software is intended to improve the speed and effectiveness of the feedback to the trainee and the NAE leadership.
