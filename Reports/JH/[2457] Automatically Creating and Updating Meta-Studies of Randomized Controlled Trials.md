Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials
================================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    A andquot meta studyandquot   or andquot meta analysisandquot   collects and analyzes many studies on the same topic to understand if there is a meaningful  overall result  Meta studies can support  or refute  interventions  spur new investigations  and lead to novel clinical guidelines  However  constructing meta studies is a time intensive process of searching the literature  compiling the results  and performing the statistical analysis  Due to the time commitment that is required  many topics are unexplored  and many meta studies are not kept up to date with the latest published results  Finally  a number of  unknown  biases  via subjective choices during the meta study  may influence the results  Our long term goal is to automate  as much as possible  the meta study process  This should decrease subjective bias  increase the dissemination of evidence  especially for diseases and interventions that receive less attention  and allow for the automatic updating of meta studies as new results are published  We propose a computer system that uses statistical machine learning to gather and group studies focused on similar interventions and outcomes  extract the necessary results from the text  and analyze the results using standard meta analysis techniques  The final output will be presented in a spreadsheet like Web interface where users can explore and even change the data and meta analyses  Our team uniquely blends technical expertise in machine learning with leadership in publishing meta studies about Inflammatory Bowel Disease  IBD   our disease of focus for our Phase I feasibility study  We are therefore qualified technically and able
to ensure that the techniques generate valid and accurate meta studies  Our Phase I results will define the current state of the art for this novel task  Further  although we will initially focus n IBD  our Phase I results will demonstrate that our approach can generalize to other diseases  eventually applying to any intervention and any disease  The feasibility shown by our Phase I results will motivate our Phase II effort where we will focus on dramatically improving the approach  yielding broad coverage of all medical literature and generating human quality meta studies  We note that by the end of Phase I we should have a viable end to end prototype  focused on IBD  which we can begin taking to market  The final product should significantly benefit our target markets given the Phase II emphasis to improve the technology  user experience  and scope of covered diseases PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   A meta analysis collects and analyzes the results from multiple studies that are all focused on the same topic  and it can confirm  or refute  the overall
effect across the studies  lead to changes in clinical guidelines  or spur new directions for research  However  generating a meta analysis is an extremely time consuming process  so many diseases are not covered  and most meta analyses are not updated to reflect the latest published studies  This work begins to automate the process of creating meta analyses  overcoming these difficulties in order to make the results published in the medical literature more accessible
