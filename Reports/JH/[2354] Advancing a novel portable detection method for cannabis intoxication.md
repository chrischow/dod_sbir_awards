Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication
=====================================================================

# Abstract


Intoxication from marijuana  MJ  impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor
vehicle accidents  The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while
intoxicated with MJ  However  there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an
individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication  Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ  THC  in
body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within    minutes  long before
impairment is resolved  And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of
these metabolites can take weeks  Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood  breath or
body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication  In response to this significant knowledge gap  this
project aims to develop an accurate  portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using
functional near infrared spectroscopy  fNIRS   fNIRS is a non invasive  safe brain imaging technique that
capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin  Hb  
that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity  fNIRS can be
performed in natural environments at low cost  and thus can be used in real world settings  In Phase I  we will
develop an algorithm for individual level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements  To do
so  we will assess the effect of oral THC  or placebo  on fNIRS measurements  self reported intoxication  and
impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert  DRE 
in    healthy MJ users  fNIRS assessments will examine     the effect of THC exposure on resting state and
task based activation in the prefrontal cortex      the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning
with THC administration correlates with THC induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS 
and     the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety
test determinants of impairment  Milestone  Should machine learning applications to the data generate an
algorithm that predicts impairment with andgt     accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test  we
will proceed to Phase II  In Phase II  we will conduct fNIRS testing in     individuals under THC placebo as in
Phase I and in    individuals in a THC plus alcohol placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for
MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with andgt     specificity  It
is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment  This will warrant
commercialization  which will be followed by prototype development and field testing  An accurate  quantitative 
biological test that is user friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential
to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous
commercial potential  as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support The goal of this project is to develop  test  and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana  MJ 
impairment using a portable  user friendly  non invasive  brain based modality  MJ doubles the chance of
motor vehicle accidents  yet  there now exists no valid  biologically based method to detect whether an
individual is acutely impaired from MJ  The development of a reliable  quantitative biological marker that
enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have
highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential
