In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers
===============================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home  The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of
life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments  Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed  stride length  stride imbalance  etc  have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health  Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting  In home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patientandapos s health under real life conditions  Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care  Accurate in home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely   The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF  An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency  RF  signals between each other  As a person walks past the transceivers  their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device  Preliminary results using only   or   transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed  Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits  Specific aims in this proposal will    further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs     research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics  a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi person discrimination capability  and    perform preliminary in home evaluations of the GaitRF system  Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics  We will evaluate the
performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single resident and multi  resident homes of seniors   If successful  this new system has the advantage of being low cost  unobtrusive  and easy to install  while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics  The system can be used as a stand alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems  Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment  Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed  stride length  stride imbalance  etc  have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health  We propose to develop a low cost system called GaitRF that can passively and unobtrusively measure detailed gait metrics in the home to support monitoring of seniors living independently or at an assisted living facility
