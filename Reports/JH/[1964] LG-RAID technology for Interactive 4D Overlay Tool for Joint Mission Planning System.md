LG-RAID technology for Interactive 4D Overlay Tool for Joint Mission Planning System
====================================================================================

# Abstract


In complex tactical scenarios, mission planners are often confronted with mission goals and operational environment restrictions that limit their options. High cognitive workloads produced by manual assessments and operational concerns increase tactical decision timeframes. To address these problems and support mission planning and operations within National and Foreign Airspaces, Space, Maritime, and Land domains, mission planners need automated planning assistance which can quickly animate (visualize) the routes and mission plans and the tactical risks to personnel and property. To maintain the tactical initiative, Mission planners and Battle Management Aids must optimize mission performance in faster than real-time under dynamic, multi-variable conditions allowing Mission Commanders to initiate tactical actions on their terms. LG-RAID addresses these shortcomings. Using LG-Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a multi-domain mission planner, LG-RAID constructs an optimal 4D, geo-rectified, animated overlay that provides entity visualization and predictive Course of Action analysis capability for dynamic, multi-variable conditions within seconds on a standard desktop computer.
