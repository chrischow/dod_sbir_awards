Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays
==================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high throughput data  In feature selection for data with large numbers of features  it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance  and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate  Similarly  there are often multiple
stages  and many parameters  involved in the multivariate assays de  signed to analyze high throughput profiles  For example  good results achieved with a particular combination of settings for an instance of cross validation may not generalize to other instances  The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning  and demonstrate effectiveness in this application  The machine learning methods to be investigated will include random forests  supervised principal components  lasso penalization and support vector machines  We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices  for determining biologically relevant thresholds  for improving the accuracy of signal identification  and for identifying suboptimal results  Relevance  Although todayandapos s high throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice  the analytical tools availble for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted
exploration of the underlying biology  This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA  In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays  transparent  interpretable  and reproducible  and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify  characterize  and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points  The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis  with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays  This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome  and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis  treatment monitoring  and therapeutic drug development PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies  However  development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised  This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols  reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems
