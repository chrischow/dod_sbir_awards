Predictor of Aircraft Structural Load Due to Buffet
===================================================

# Abstract


Global Engineering and Materials, Inc., along with its team members, Iowa State University, Technical Data Analysis, Inc., and YB Numerics, Inc., proposes to develop a buffet-induced aircraft structural response and multiaxial fatigue damage prediction software via a hybrid immersogeometric and boundary-fitted (BF) compressible-flow fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation and subsequent hybrid time- and frequency-domain multiaxial fatigue damage assessment. The software immersed the majority of the high-fidelity aircraft model into the fluid domain while modeled other critical parts (e.g., horizontal stabilizers) in a BF manner. For the structural description, an IGA-based multi-patch analysis approach is used to accurately model the critical parts while a super-element approach is employed elsewhere with imposed modal superposition. The predicted structural response is then analyzed using a hybrid time- and frequency-domain fatigue damage evaluation module to account for the non-stationarity of the problem. Specifically, a critical plane approach is firstly adopted to identify the fatigue fracture plane, and the entire flight profile is then segmented into stationary and non-stationary parts for fatigue damage evaluation based on frequency-domain and time-domain methods, respectively. The developed software will be validated against existing IAT and flight test data. A machine learning model will be constructed after validation for quick response/damage prediction and eventually integrated into the current IAT system. The developed high-fidelity software “BLAST” is anticipated to be able to quickly and reliably evaluate all flight conditions to isolate fatigue critical spots of an aircraft subjected to a combined normal operational and buffet-induced non-stationary loading.
