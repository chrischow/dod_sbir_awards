# Abstract


Project Summary Abstract Acute gastroenteritisAGEinfectious diarrhea is a common condition that is costly in the US and highmortality in developing nationsThe cornerstone of AGE management is oral rehydration therapyORTan evidence based technique that has saved overmillion lives in theyears since its introductionThe problem we aim to address is ORT s underuse in developed countries specifically in the home settingIf widely adoptedORT could reduceof AGE related healthcare visits and costs among childreneliminatingmillion emergency department visits and $billion in hospital costs annuallyThe product of this Phase I proposal is a minimum viable product of a mobile health applicationappORCAHOrally Rehydrate Children at Homethat guides caregivers of dehydrated children through administering ORT in the homeORCAHandapos s innovation is in the use of the mobile deviceandapos s native functions for analyticsdatabase parameterstimersnotificationsand process state for a novel aimmaking ORT accessible in the home setting in developed countriesWe hypothesize we will achieve an effectivenesspercentage of ORT tasks completedofWe will achieve our objective throughAimsAimUse key informant interviews with card sort testing to explicitly understand subjectsprioritization of ORT workflow tasks and how to deliver these in a usercentered design interfaceand thereby develop the optimal information architecture of ORCAHAimPerform cycles of iterativeuser centered design using a synchronous remote platform to optimize the app s usabilityAimPilot test ORCAH in a simulation context to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial of the app using synchronous online methodsBased on the impact of ORT in developing settingsthe gap presented by the absence of an intervention for improving home ORT use in developing countriesand the match between the key advantages of mobile health apps and the ORT underuse problemwe expect that the ORCAH app will provide a usability optimizedeffective and efficient technology for supporting home ORT delivery that will ultimately allow users to avoid costly and inconvenient ED visitsObjectives for Phase II include trialing ORCAH s efficacy compared to usual care and further developing ORCAH to include a cloud based machine learning algorithm that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patientgenerated data and will provide generalizable evidence about ORT dosingThe long term goals are to further develop the machine learning functionalities to update best practices for ORTand to develop ORCAH for developing settingsThe market for ORCAH caregivers of children with AGE represents a promising commercial potentialas aboutmillion children in the US experience an AGE episode annually of at leasthours durationData Care s commercialization strategy includes direct business to consumer marketingas well as co marketing with business partners including after hours advice centersrehydration fluid companies and urgent care centers Project NarrativeAcute gastroenteritis infectious diarrhea is a high mortality condition in developing nationswhere a public health intervention called oral rehydration therapyORThas saved overmillion lives and is considered the cornerstone of managementhoweverORT is underused in developed nations including the United Statesresulting in an estimated excess ofmillion emergency department visits by children and $billion in hospital costs for children annuallyThrough developing a mobile health application ORCAHOrally Rehydrate Children at Homethat guides caregivers of dehydrated children through giving ORT in the household settingwe expect that this application will enhance health and reduce illness in the short term by enabling users to avoid costly and inconvenient emergency department visitsand the associated costsIn the long termthrough adding a cloud based machine learning algorithm to ORCAH that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient generated datawe expect to generate generalizable evidence about ORT dosing parameters that will improve the sciencedelivery and efficacy of ORT
