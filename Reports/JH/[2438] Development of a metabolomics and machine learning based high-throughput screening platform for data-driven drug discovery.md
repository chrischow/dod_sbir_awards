Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery
==========================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Project Summary
High throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the
past decade have become exponentially less expensiveCoupling these developing emerging technologies with
automation approaches and the phenotypic based drug discovery paradigm allows fordata drivendrug
discoveryDDfocuses on a complete cellular readoutquantitatively measurings tos of
biomoleculesrather than focusing on a single proteinpathwayor physiological traitThe complexity of this data
requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretationA pioneering project and dataset for Dis
the Broad Institute s Connectivity Mapwhich is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug
characterizationdiscoveryand repositioningThough with many successesthe Connectivity Map is based on
only a single biomolecule typeRNAand downstream effects caused by chemical perturbations to proteins and
metabolites are ignoredIn this proposalwe combine the dual strengths of experts in LC MS MS based
metabolomicsOmix Technologieswith leaders in metabolic network modeling and metabolomics data analysisSinopia Biosciencesto develop a metabolomics based high throughput compound screening platformOur
preliminary data for two major drugsdoxorubicin and rapamycinshowcases that our approach has technical
validityaccuracyand provides potential biological utility that complements transcriptomics based approachesThis Phase I proposal will assess the biological utility of a metabolomics based screening platformFirstwe will
profileFDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classesSecondwe will develop the
necessary bioinformatics pipelinesmechanistic metabolic modelsand machine learning algorithms to analyze
and interpret these complex datasetsFinallywe will assess whether adding metabolomics data to the
Connectivity Map boosts Dpredictions including assessing compound mechanisms of actionscompound
similarityidentifying biomarkers for drug efficacy and safetyand identifying drug repurposing opportunitiesAfter the biological utility of this approach is demonstrated in Phase IPhase II will focus on profiling of novel
chemical and genetic perturbations to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial
opportunities for treating rare genetic diseases Project Narrative
Data driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelinesdecrease costsand ultimately provide better care to patientsCombining Sinopia Bioscience s
and Omix Technologies strengths in high throughput data generation and analysiswe will build
a unique platform focused on the impact of human metabolism in diseaseThis proposal will test
the viability of this approach and focus on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet
needs
