Autonomous and Intelligent Aircraft Maintenance Technologies
============================================================

# Abstract


Compass systems Inc. and its team possess the intellectual knowledge base and have sufficient expertise in robotic systems to develop autonomous and intelligent aircraft maintenance systems. We are poised to integrate artificial intelligence, sensors, and robotic capabilities to deliver an autonomous maintenance platform that will offer greater reliability, precision and throughput while reducing scheduled maintenance cycle time. By leveraging our expertise in research and development, we plan to design a multi-purpose and mobile robotic maintenance platform that will integrate several task-specific devices called End Effectors (EEFs).  The developed EEFs will be designed to automate the current manual labor intensive maintenance processes.   Upon completion of our design and development efforts, we will be able to provide a feasibility comparison for the robotic maintenance platform and EEFs against existing naval aircraft maintenance processes. The concept is to have these advanced autonomous maintenance systems augment the current maintainer’s abilities and capacity by applying smart repeatable AI technologies. This effort would ultimately increase readiness while decreasing scheduled maintenance downtime for aircraft, ground support equipment and Aviation Depot Level Repair (AVDLR) components.
