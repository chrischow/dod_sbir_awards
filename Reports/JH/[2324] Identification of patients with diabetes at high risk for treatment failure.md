Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure
===========================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources  Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose target to enable cost effective implementation of resource intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high risk individuals   Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs  Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations  However  it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost effective   One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patientsandapos  functional status  social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents  from which it is difficult to extract  Furthermore  the amount of information about any single patient i the medical record is enormous  and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis   In the proposed project investigators will combine two novel technologies   natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic   to help circumvent these challenges to build a high accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes  Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient  Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear  Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow to greatly increasing the number of factors   variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control  and ultimately improve their accuracy  Consequently this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose  decrease the rate of diabetes complications  improve the patientsandapos  quality of life and help control the rising costs of healthcare    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Lowering blood glucose of patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life and reduce healthcare costs  but may be more difficult for some patients than others  Patients who have particularly high barriers to blood glucose control could benefit from extra resources  but it can be challenging to identify them in advance  In this projec the investigators will combine advanced computational technologies including artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify patients with diabetes at high risk for difficulty lowering blood glucose to help make commitment of additional resources cost effective
