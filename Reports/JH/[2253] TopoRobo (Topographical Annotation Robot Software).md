TopoRobo (Topographical Annotation Robot Software)
==================================================

# Abstract


Next Century Corporation proposes to create TopoRobo (topographical annotation robot software) to automatically extract depth-orderedlists of ridge polylines overlaid on an image or video mosaics to feed topography-based geolocation algorithms. TopoRobo will leverage deepneural network machine learning methods optimized for topographical features through EvoDevo, Next Centurys algorithm to grow and trainneural network architectures based on evolutionary development principles. For TopoRobo, EvoDevo will enhance the classification layers ofcurrent deep neural network architectures to tune them for precise topographical feature extraction.
