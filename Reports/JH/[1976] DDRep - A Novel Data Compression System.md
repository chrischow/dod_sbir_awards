DDRep: A Novel Data Compression System
======================================

# Abstract


This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the need for innovative algorithms that convert acoustic time-domain data into a compressed data stream that is transmitted via satellite communications (SATCOM) and reassembled with low latency upon its receipt. The Navy requires 100% preservation of the acoustic data to be transmitted in real-time for processing at shore facilities. drivewarps novel approach involves genetic and machine learning algorithms combined with a proprietary reference data block library that disassembles and reassembles data in real-time. Dynamic data replication (DDRep) technology replaces the original data with assembly instructions (metadata) and reference data blocks stored on both the sending and receiving device. The metadata can be transmitted and then stored until needed, and the audio files reassembled at that time. drivewarps state-of-the-art technology significantly reduces bandwidth and storage requirements and allows reference data sets to be stored separately from the metadata, enabling a high degree of security. DDRep can be used on any networked device for real-time data reduction and transmission and would decrease the Navys deployment costs by enabling the use of an inexpensive unmanned vessel to collect acoustic data, saving $50k-100k per day for the DoN.
