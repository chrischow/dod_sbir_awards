BotSwain, Robotic Coxswain Behavior for High Sea-State Navigation
=================================================================

# Abstract


An Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) needs to weigh mission accomplishment against potential damage from high seas. Once in a high-seas situation, the best immediate course and speed to minimize vessel motions may not coincide with the best path away from the storm. The USV needs a modular maneuvering behavior that balances overall mission accomplishment, immediate avoidance of excessive motions, and longer-term maneuvering away from projected high-seas areas. FTL's “BotSwain (Robotic Coxswain)” is a USV behavior module that emulates the behavior of an expert human coxswain, not only perceiving the dynamic wave field, but also anticipating wave motion to optimize a vessel's navigation path. It harnesses modern 3D wave sensing technology alongside powerful wave field reconstruction and robot navigation concepts based on established machine learning research developed at FTL. BotSwain enables fast and direct measurement of the local wave-tracking data products such as the directional wave spectrum, and wave crest size, heading, and velocity. This provides BotSwain with real-time awareness of the local wave field with a detection range suitable to acquire actionable data for wave and storm avoidance and USV stabilization. Using machine learning algorithms developed at FTL, the BotSwain software is trained to utilize this information to make decisions as a human would, and in some cases, make better decisions for the path of the USV based on current ocean and weather conditions.
