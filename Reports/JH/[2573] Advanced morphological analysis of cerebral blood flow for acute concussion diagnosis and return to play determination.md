# Abstract


Project Summary   Abstract
Between     and     million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone  Reliable diagnosis and prompt
treatments are vital to managing the often serious short and long term sequelae resulting from mild TBI 
However  a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting  and in
particular for determining RTP readiness  has eluded the clinical community  Current diagnosis and RTP
assessments are based on patient symptoms  neurocognitive evaluations  and   or physical performance
testing  Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability 
Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests  such as balance tests   although less subjective  require pre 
injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject to subject variations in evaluation
performances  Due to these reasons  current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are
not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI 
This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury  mild TBI  based on
physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance  The method is
based on quantification of well known physiologic changes after a concussion  i e  the impairment of autonomic
function and altered cerebral blood flow  CBF  as measured with transcranial Doppler  TCD   The novelty of
the proposed approach is the use of a recently developed analytical machine learning framework for the
analysis of the CBF velocity  CBFV  waveforms  In contrast to previous methods used before  the proposed
approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform  thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow
that are lost in other analysis methods  Additionally  comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI
will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind 
The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for
reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist  The outcome will be
a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments  neurology
clinics  and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management Project Narrative
Traumatic brain injury  TBI  is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a
substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability  Mild TBI concussions account for over
    of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis diagnosis due to lack of objective
measures and delayed onset of symptoms  This project aims to develop the first objective concussion
evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle  physiologic changes in
cerebral hemodynamics  Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device
suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today
