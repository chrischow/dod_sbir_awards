HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments
===================================================================================

# Abstract


DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment  Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases  The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine learning algorithms to identify relevant and on target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals  This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes  RPS   and RPS   in multiple human cell types  Mutations in these genes are the primary cause of Diamond Blackfan Anemia  a rare genetic disease with no specific targeted therapy  In this grant  we propose to  develop RPS   and RPS   knockout cell lines using CRISPR Cas  technology  evaluate knockout cell lines for phenotypes  andapos phenoprintsandapos   using our drug discovery platform  conduct chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates to identify those that  ameliorate on target phenoprints associated with loss of RPS   and RPS    expand the capabilities of our drug screening platform to enable the use of non adherent cell lines in  our workflow and use the expanded capabilities to confirm the validity of drugs identifie as candidate therapies in  CD    suspended cell culture models of Diamond Blackfan Anemia  Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience  tools  and drive to execute this Phase I SBIR proposal  and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds arising from the project  The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications    
   
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Diamond Blackfan Anemia  DBA  is a rare genetic disease for which no targeted therapy exists  Loss of function in RPS   and RPS    or other ribosomal protein genes  results in the disease  We will use chemical suppressor screens of known drugs  based on structural changes in cellular disease models  to identify potential therapeutics for treatment of DBA
