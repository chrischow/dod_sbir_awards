Artificial Intelligence Technique Applied to Cross-Domain Solution
==================================================================

# Abstract


BCL proposes researching an AI/Natural Language Processing based Information Classification and Filtering System that finds and extracts relevant concepts from free text. The proposed approach utilizes syntactic-semantic information from input text to come up with 'semantic classifications' of themes that get tagged to a particular category such as NATO, CIA, FBI, ISI etc. In its Phase I research, BCL will evaluate COTS CDS systems and methods, and AI methods such as NLP, Machine learning, pattern recognition, and translation systems to provide sanitization techniques in Cross-Domain Solutions. In its Phase I efforts, BCL will develop a proof-of-concept design for a syntactic-semantic based CDS system in a particular domain (e.g. terrorism). The proposed system rests upon the extensive research BCL has conducted in Natural Language Processing. At the end of Phase I, BCL will recommend a combination of the best methods that promise to provide an information filtering and classification methods for CDS systems.
