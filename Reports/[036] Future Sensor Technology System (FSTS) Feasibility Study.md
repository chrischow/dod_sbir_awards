Future Sensor Technology System (FSTS) Feasibility Study
========================================================

# Abstract


The FSTS proposed technology is an important technology step into the future. One of the important features of the proposed AFWERX FSTS SBIR solution is it marries completely with the future. The new Iridium NEXT communications constellation was just completed this year and has a 20 to 30 year expected life. The new constellation has important security; anti jam; satellite timing and location (STL), total global coverage, extremely low latency, and low power consumption ground sensors to communicate from anywhere in the world. McQ has two new commercial sensors it will demonstrate sending target information through Iridium. The proposed SBIR approach removes the large cost and operational difficulty of setting up terrestrial communications by using the global Iridium communications network. Target data is available immediately when sensors are deployed. Secure distribution of situation awareness information is available as soon as a sensor mission begins. This architecture permits very fast Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Fusion processing that can quickly screen large Big Data information. Geo referenced data is then tailored in seconds for reporting to Command Centers and field operators at the edge. Multi source information fusion and AI can provide new advances in ISR information under the proposed concept.
