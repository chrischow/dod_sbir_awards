Deep Machine learning for risk Analysis and Prediction (D-MAP) in supply chains
===============================================================================

# Abstract


Globalization and digitization have been driving the recent economic growth at the expense of raising the risk level in the supply chain related to fraud, security, and safety, while current practice of supply chain management and risk assessment is lagging far behind. Therefore, commercial industries and government agencies are seeking advanced supply chain risk assessment solutions, which can effectively assess and predict the risks through advanced analytics on various novel data sources and suggest/recommend mitigation strategies to help better manage supply chains in the face of potential risks and support high fidelity and timely decisions. To address this critical need, IAI proposes to design and implement the D-MAP system that provides a unified framework with the following novel capabilities: 1) Data Management that automatically collects raw data from multiple data sources, improves data quality, processes raw data to obtain both features and ground truth to facilitate further analysis; 2) Risk Prediction that applies advanced analytics to predict future risks in a supply chain building upon risk identification from realistic risk scenarios; (3) Risk Mitigation that recommends approaches to mitigate risks such that a supply chain can be improved to meet its mission requirements.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)
