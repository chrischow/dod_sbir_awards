Tactical Immune System (TIS)
============================

# Abstract


Our goal in Phase II STTR proposal is to leverage the tools and data analytics algorithms developed in Phase I to demonstrate the full functionality of the proposed Tactical Cyber Immune System (TCIS). We have developed a modular and adaptive cyber immunity system to overcome security deficiencies of current computing systems. We have developed algorithms and tools to characterize the self-behavior of “Computer”, “User”, and “Application” so that each behavior can be identified as either "Self" or "Non-Self". The Phase I results that will be leveraged are: 1) Self-behavior Model for Computers: Data analytics techniques are used to build the self-behavior model. Our results show that our approach achieved almost 100% accurate detection rate; 2) Self-behavior Model for Users: Data analytics techniques are used to build the self-behavior model. Phase 1 results show that our approach can successfully classify user normal versus malicious with accuracy more than 99%; and 3) Self-behavior Model for Applications: The self-behavior model produced zero false negatives and detection accuracy was around 99.51%. In Phase II, we will build a fully function TCIS prototype using AVIRTEK autonomic cyber security technology and the tools and data analytics algorithms developed in Phase I.
