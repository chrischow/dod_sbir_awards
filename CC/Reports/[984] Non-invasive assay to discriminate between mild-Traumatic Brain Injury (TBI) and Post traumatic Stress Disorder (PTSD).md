Non-invasive assay to discriminate between mild-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
======================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The objective of this project is the development of an assessment system that will be able to determine the likelihood of a warrior having suffered a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The basis of the determination will be a computerized assessment of the functioning of the II, III, IV, VI, and VIII cranial nerves. This set of nerves provides the opportunity to obtain a sensitive and quantitative evaluation of two critical physiological control systems, eye movement and postural balance, that are, because of their high degree of sophistication, very sensitive to cerebral injury.   In conjunction with mTBI experts part of the aim of the Phase I effort will be to evaluate and down-select different eye movement tracking and postural control assessment technologies and neurological testing criteria. In addition, control algorithms based on established machine learning approaches will be designed to enable the system to integrate inputs from the multiple sensor systems and to make categorical decisions. Comprehensive plans for Phase II for the construction of a prototype system and its testing in a population of injured warriors large enough to yield statistically significant results to support the validity of the neurological testing criteria will be laid out.
