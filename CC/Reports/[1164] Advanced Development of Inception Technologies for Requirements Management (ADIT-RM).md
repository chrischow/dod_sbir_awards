Advanced Development of Inception Technologies for Requirements Management (ADIT-RM)
====================================================================================

# Abstract


Preliminary definition and analysis of Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) requirements in an isolated, manual, and loosely controlled change environment shows significant overlap in effort, resulting in a major increase to cost, schedule, mission classification, subsystem propagation, and trace of system impacts. To assist MDA with movement of BMDS mission objectives to mission requirements, Modus Operandi proposes a collaborative requirements management web-based tool to provide real-time monitoring and input to requirements, building on current Inception SBIR technology. Advanced Development of Inception Technologies for Requirements Management (ADIT-RM) will replace manual analysis and search with the inclusion of historical, gap, impact, and coverage investigation using entity management, artificial intelligence(AI), and machine learning (ML) for base modeling and continual knowledge capture. ADIT-RM will include the ability to validate, capture, and properly scope M&S Digital requirements prior to full-scale implementation. A wiki view will be developed for each individual requirement enabling stakeholder collaboration over M&S artifacts and allowing stakeholders to query and analyze “needs” and persist all information in a central knowledge base. Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9817 (23 Oct 18)
