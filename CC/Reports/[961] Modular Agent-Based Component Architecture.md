Modular Agent-Based Component Architecture
==========================================

# Abstract


Cybernet proposes to create a software architecture that will allow off-the-shelf autonomous software agents to make use of artificial intelligence (AI) modules to solve a number of problems in the Army weapons fire domain.  This system will be designed for compatibility with Future Combat Systems (FCS) by making it compliant with the System of Systems Common Operating Environment (SoS COE) specification.  A number of AI techniques will be explored, including belief networks (Bayesian, Dempster-Shafer), rule-based systems, goal-directed systems, and constraint programming systems.
