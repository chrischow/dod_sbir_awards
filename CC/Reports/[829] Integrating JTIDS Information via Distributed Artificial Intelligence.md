Integrating JTIDS Information via Distributed Artificial Intelligence
=====================================================================

# Abstract


We propose determining the feasibility of employing distributed artificial intelligence algorithms and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) to (1) integrate heterogeneous, geographicaly dispersed information and knowledge sources (for improved siti\uation awareness) (2) facilitate remote data collection whit\le sensors are not operational (e.g., while employing only passive sensors or after losing equipment due to malfunction or injury), and (3) facilitate coordinated actions in cooperative maneuvers and tactics. Our approach is based-upon aknowledge-based tool designed for fault-toleratn, real-time, distributed processing.
