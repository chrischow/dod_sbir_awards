Automated Algorithm Generator for Ground Vehicle Diagnostics/Prognostics
========================================================================

# Abstract


The Automated Algorithm Generator combines a Library of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms with an automated Framework system to completely automate health and readiness reporting from widely dispersed Army combat and support vehicles.  The system provides an environment in which learning algorithms enhance quality and reliability of platform status, health, and readiness reporting.  The algorithm library draws on current research in brain function and artificial intelligence.  The framework structure delivers a highly flexible, highly expandable skeleton for distribution of algorithms, reports management, configuration management, health and readiness distribution, user interfaces, and archive methodology.  The framework is a loosely-coupled system constructed from generic software modules that host the algorithms and perform common system services such as built-in test, operator intervention, and extraction of system performance metrics.
