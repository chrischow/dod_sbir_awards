Intelligent Data Exploration and Trending Engine (IDEATE)
=========================================================

# Abstract


Seed Innovations (Seed) and the University of Colorado in Denver (UCD) apply our experience in natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence, big data, data analytics, automatic code generation, framework development, and software architecture to accomplish the research required. Through the research on this project, Seed and UCD design and develop a proof-of-concept system, Intelligent Data Exploration and Trending Engine (IDEATE). IDEATE interacts with users using natural language statements and queries, determines the data analysis required, retrieves the relevant data, performs the required data analysis, and reports the results back to user using natural language dialog, tables, visualizations, etc. IDEATE uses both recognition and generation natural language processing (NLP) to conduct an informed natural language dialog with the user performing data analysis across very large data sets. These data sets may include traditional relational databases, non-relational databases, as well as various flat file formats. For the IDEATE proof-of-concept, Seed and UCD apply modern software techniques including NLP, analysis workflow generation and execution, data modeling, and data analytics to support effective analysis of complex simulation results to help the warfighter. When deployed to meet MDAâ€™s simulation analysis challenge, IDEATE substantially reduces the time for data analytics and increasing data analyst efficiency. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10398 (2 Mar 20)
