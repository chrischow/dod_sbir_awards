Alternate GPS Anti-Jam Technology
=================================

# Abstract


GPS anti-jam has long been a major concern for military users. Controlled Radiation Pattern Antennas (CRPAs), have dominated military anti-jam solutions, however, CRPAs are costly, require a great deal of power, and are inherently limited in the number of spatial nulls that can be formed. Phase I investigates a combination of Jamming Detection and Classification with an Anti-Jam Toolbox and Machine Learning to apply the right solution with the minimum essential power consumption needed to achieve the desired performance. We will evaluate methods of using current technology to intelligently suppress jamming while minimizing the consumption of energy and consequently minimize the battery burden for dismounted soldiers and other power-limited users. We will evaluate two implementation techniques: integrating the anti-jam system in existing receivers from the ground up; or developing an external applique that can be added to receivers, replacing the antenna, or placed between the receiver and antenna. Phase I will result in a high level specification and Phase I Option will result in a detailed specification for the most suitable implementation strategy. Success in either implementation strategy holds commercialization promise for all platforms desiring a low cost and low power anti-jam solution, such as handhelds, munitions, and certain ground
