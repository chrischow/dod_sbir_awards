Electronically Switchable Optical Filter
========================================

# Abstract


This SBIR Phase II proposal proposes to develop a formal prototype of a fast speed electronically Switchable Optical Filter in 900-1700nm. The result is a compact plate-like filter with 50mm optical aperture in diameter and 3.4mm physical thickness. The filter can be electronically switched between a broadband transmission state over the entire 900-1700nm and a narrow bandpass transmission at 1,550nm with a bandwidth =5nm. The switching from one mode to another is completely stationary and fast within
