Autonomous Ruggedized Combat Casualty Care- Diagnostics (ARC3-D)
================================================================

# Abstract


In the near future, the Warfighter may face prolonged isolation and sustained denial of support on the battlefield, and may have no access to medical support. To become more resilient to these challenges, the Warfighter will need additional, innovative support to provide Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC). Intelligent decision-support software, teleoperated trauma care systems, and fully autonomous trauma care robotics are intriguing solutions. In addition to performing patient monitoring and intervention, these solutions must intelligently diagnose multiple injuries and produce prioritized treatment plans. To address these challenges, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Autonomous Ruggedized Combat Casualty CareDiagnostics (ARC3-D), a modular, intelligent framework for autonomous combat casualty care. ARC3-D combines behavioral modeling based on trauma treatment algorithms and procedures with machine learning that can reason under uncertainty to continually produce and refine diagnoses of traumatic injury, as well as produce prioritized TCCC treatment plans that can then be used by intervention subsystems connected to ARC3-D.
