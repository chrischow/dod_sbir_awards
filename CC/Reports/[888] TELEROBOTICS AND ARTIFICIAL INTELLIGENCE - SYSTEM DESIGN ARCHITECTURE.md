TELEROBOTICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: SYSTEM DESIGN ARCHITECTURE
====================================================================

# Abstract


THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A REASONING AND PLANNING SYSTEM CAPABLE OF ISSUING COMMANDS TO A ROBOT. WE INTEND TO DEMONSTRATE A ROBOT INVOLVED IN A REASONING TASK. WE WILL USE AN OBJECT-ORIENTED APPROACH. OUR PLAN ISTO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS, REAL TIME CONTROL GROUP SINCE THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN THIS AREA. THIS PROJECT IS REALLY THE MERGER OF REAL TIME CONTROL AND REASONING AND PLANNING. ONE CAN LOOK UPON THIS PROJECT AS THE PHASE BEFORE GEOMETRICREASONING. THE EXTENSION OF THIS RESEARCH TO IN-SPACE EXPERIMENTS AND MAINTENANCE IS STRAIGHT FORWARD. THE PROBLEM SOLVING, CONTROL METHODS, AND SEARCH TECHNIQUES WOULD BE VERY MUCH THE SAME IN SPACE AS WE PERFORM ON THIS PROJECT IN THE LAB.
