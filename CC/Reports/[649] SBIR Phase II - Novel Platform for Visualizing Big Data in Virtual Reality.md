SBIR Phase II: Novel Platform for Visualizing Big Data in Virtual Reality
=========================================================================

# Abstract


The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a fundamental advancement in the way people see, understand, and work with geospatial data. The proposed research will commercialize immersive analytics technology across the telecom, Internet of Things (IoT), and transportation industries, all of which use outdated 2D mapping tools. This technology can also improve visualization of data regarding environmental changes, health crises, and other changing situations. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project fuses augmented reality and virtual reality with artificial intelligence to address data visualization pain points in the telecom sector. Like the buildings they inhabit, wireless signals exist in three dimensions and are difficult to represent through traditional 2D charts and graphs. The objective of this research is to develop a an immersive analytics platform where users literally step inside their geodata and manipulate it in real time. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
