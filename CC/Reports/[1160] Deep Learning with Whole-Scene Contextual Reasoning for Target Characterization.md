Deep Learning with Whole-Scene Contextual Reasoning for Target Characterization
===============================================================================

# Abstract


ExoAnalytic Solutions  is developing DEEPR (Deep Learning with Whole-Scene Contextual Reasoning for Object Characterization), an advanced multi-sensor multi-object classifier for integrated object characterization. The overall objective of DEEPR is to develop a suite of advanced, novel techniques that combine innovative advances in deep, hierarchical machine learning together with recurrent Deep Learning Neural Network (DNN) methods for sensor fusion, along with Dynamic and Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (DBNs and MEBNs) for whole-scene and contextual reasoning.  Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9219 (31 May 17)
