Automated Algorithm Generator for Ground Vehicle Diagnostics/Prognostics
========================================================================

# Abstract


The Automated Algorithm Generator combines a distributed Framework infrastructure with a Library of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms to automate health reporting from widely dispersed Army combat and support vehicles. The Framework is a highly flexible and expandable skeleton for distribution of embedded algorithms, health assessment execution, report management, configuration management, health results distribution, user interfaces, and archive methodology. The Framework is a loosely-coupled system constructed from generic software modules that host algorithms and perform system services such as data acquisition, built-in test, system decision processes. and distillation of system performance metrics. The Library is a collection of analytical routines, configuration profiles, and learning functions that automate condition-based maintenance in embedded systems. The algorithm Library draws on current research in brain function and artificial intelligence to provide a learning environment where the system enhances quality and reliability of platform status, health, and readiness reporting.
