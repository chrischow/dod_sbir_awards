Intelligent Network Architect (iNA) for Monitoring Denied/Degraded Environments (D2E) in Fleet Synthetic Training
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


DMI proposes to further design and develop iNA to support training instructors in providing trainees with a Denied and Degraded Environment (D2E) picture that can be monitored and adapted to stimulate trainees within Fleet Synthetic Training events. This capability shall enable instructors to effect and monitor traineesâ€™ communications and command and control (C2) systems in realistic ways (e.g. simulated jamming) during events. The intelligent Network Architect (iNA) console is a software application that enables analysts, cyber specialists, and Joint Interface Control Officers (JICOs) to: construct a visual model of a network that they are interested in monitoring, connect it to the actual physical network, and visually monitor for issues as they occur. The iNA console, however, does more than look at bits or packet traffic. It can be used to intelligently monitor specific message formats such as DoD TADIL-J or USMTF, parse the content and make intelligent decisions based on what it reads. iNA uses a powerful and flexible underlying artificial intelligence engine that leverages specific "analysis plugins" to reason about what is happening on the network. iNA enables the user to set up expectations that assist them in tracking events and activities occurring on the network.
