Question Answering for Data Analytics
=====================================

# Abstract


This topic seeks an innovative NL solution for answering questions that data analysts ask when analyzing data sets to increase efficiency and consistency. The government is working on an all-digital missile defense simulation architecture that will deliver massive amounts of simulation data. Data analysts will soon be inundated with more data than they can possibly analyze manually. A critical part of the analysis will be identifying key trends and relationships within and across data sets; and identifying them quickly and efficiently. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10398 (2 Mar 20)
