Autonomous, In-Situ Detection and Speciation of Biofilms Within Extended Spaceflight Water Systems
==================================================================================================

# Abstract


Extended space missions require that potable water be stored or recycled over periods of time that leave the water supply vulnerable to microbial contamination. Microbial colonies form as difficult-to-eradicate biofilms, contaminating the bulk water at unpredictable rates, and are impossible to quantify using standard grab sampling techniques. The proposed technology leverages microbial propensities for biofilm formation to concentrate the microbes on a stationary optical element. Optowares will utilize a proven combination of molecular fingerprinting with machine learning, with which they have previously demonstrated microbial speciation and an LOD of le;100 CFU/mL for water contaminating species such as P. Aeruginosa. The system will be multiplexable, self-cleaning, automated, can run continuously without user input, and results may be accessed remotely.
