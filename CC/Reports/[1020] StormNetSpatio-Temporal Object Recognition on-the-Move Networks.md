===============================================================

# Abstract


Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) remain a serious threat to our warfighters in asymmetrical warfare scenarios. Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to leverage its expertise in object detection, classification, and machine learning technology to develop a robust object and threat detection for military vehicle operations. We call our approach Spatio-Temporal Object Recognition on-the-Move Networks or StormNet. StormNet inserts a suite of Deep Learning techniques into a generalized machine learning framework that is capable of learning to detect multiple types of threats and measure the threat assessment scores for on-the-move video.
