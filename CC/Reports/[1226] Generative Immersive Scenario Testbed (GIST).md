Generative Immersive Scenario Testbed (GIST)
============================================

# Abstract


There is an opportunity to consolidate interrelated, emerging technological capabilities for rapidly translating 2-D visual content into 3-D models and building human behavior models for making immersive training environments. Advances in machine learning (ML) offer potential for automating aspects of the scenario generation process, including the rapid permutation of environmental models and realistic HBMs to vary and increase the number of scenarios. Design Interactive Inc. will develop the Generative Immersive Scenario Testbed (GIST), an integrated ecosystem for rapid generation of training scenarios, including realistic virtual humans, from 2-D visual inputs from real settings. GIST integrates 3-D modeling from crowdsourcing, photogrammetry, and machine learning analysis with human behavior modeling approaches to convert 2-D content into 3-D immersive environments. It provides an interface so that instructors can select multiple parameters for varying the realistic training experience. Components include: a user interface, reality modeling technology, machine learning, a game engine, and AR/VR technology.
