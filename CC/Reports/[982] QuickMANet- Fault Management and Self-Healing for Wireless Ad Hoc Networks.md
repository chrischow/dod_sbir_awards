QuickMANet- Fault Management and Self-Healing for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
==========================================================================

# Abstract


Complex wireless ad hoc networks present unique and substantial challenges in the presence of faults, and unlike wire networks, faults are typically transient and quite common. In response to these challenges, QuickFlex, Inc. proposes QuickMANet, a novel fault management, diagnosis, and self-healing system for wireless ad hoc networks. QuickMANet uses distributed, cooperating management nodes in the virtual hierarchy that enables a global fault status perspective even on very large wireless ad hoc networks, including those with mobile elements. The system relies on real-time network modeling of potential faults as fault signatures are observed in the operating network. The modeling helps to define the search space relevant to a particular observed signature, and this information is then used to drive an artificial intelligence-based diagnosis and self-healing response capability. The QuickMANet concept is highly scalable, adaptable, protocol-independent, and spans both wired and wireless networks.
