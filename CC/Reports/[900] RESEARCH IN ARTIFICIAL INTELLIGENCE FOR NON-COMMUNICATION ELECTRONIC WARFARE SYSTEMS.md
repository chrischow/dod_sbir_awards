RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR NON-COMMUNICATION ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS
====================================================================================

# Abstract


THE PROGRAM DEFINES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A SYSTEM SUPERVISORY CONTROL FUNCTION FOR ESM AND EW PLATFORMS, APPLICABLE TO THE US ARMY QUICK FIX SYSTEM. THE PROJECT INCORPORATES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/EXPERT SYSTEM TECHNIQUES TO STRUCTURE THE DESIGN ARCHITECTURE AND CONDUCT THE KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE CONTROL STRUCTURE (INTERFERENCE ENGINE) AND THE KNOWLEDGE DATA BASE. THE EFFORT ATTEMPTS TO CAPTURE USER MISSION OBJECTIVES AND EXPERT EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND JUDGEMENT; CORRELATE AND INTEGRATE INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE SENSORS, SUCH AS ESM, COMMUNICATIONS, AND REL-NAV SYSTEMS; PROCESS AND PRIORITIZE THE BATTLEFIELD ENVIRONMENT/SCENARIO; ASSIGN JAMMING RESOURCES, OPTIMIZE AND MANAGE ECM TECHNIQUES, AND CONDUCT POWER MANAGEMENT; RESOLVE RESOURCE CONFLICTS; INTERFACE WITH HUMAN OPERATORS AT SELECTABLE ATTRIBUTE LEVELS TO ALLOW DEGRESS OF AUTONOMOUS OPERTOR INTERACTIVE OPERATION. THE PROJECT CONDUCTS THE NECESSARYRESEARCH TO PLAN, MECHANIZE AND DEMONSTRATE A PROTOTYPE DESIGN.
