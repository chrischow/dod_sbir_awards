THE GENERIC ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXPERT SYSTEM FOR SPACE-STATION APPLICATIONS WILL BE USER-FRIENDLY AND WILL UTILIZE A HIERARCHY OF FRAMES FOR DATA INPUT, AUTOMATIC FAULT DIAGNOSIS AND ANALYSIS AND REPAIR FUNCTIONS. IT WILL PROVIDE PROMPT DIAGNOSIS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR SYSTEM REPAIR. IT WILL PROVIDE AS MUCH AUTOMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR REPAIR FUNCTIONS. THE DESIGN WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR INTERFACING WITH ROBOTIC MAINTENANCE CAPABILITIES. THE SYSTEM WILL BE CAPABLE OF REAL-TIME AUTOMATIC FAULT DIAGNOSIS. THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO BE STRUCTURED SO AS TO BE USEFUL AS A TRAINING TOOL FOR TEACHING FAULT DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR SKILLS TO PERSONNEL. THE DESIGN FOR THE EXPERT SYSTEM WILL INCORPORATE PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS AND MAINTENANCE HISTORY AS AN AID TO DIAGNOSIS. IT WILL CONTAIN THE 3 MODULES OF A KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEM: SITUATION DATA BASE, KNOWLEDGE DATA BASE, AND CONTROL SECTION. THE SYSTEM WILL BE DESIGNED FOR INTERATIVE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE INCREMENTS AND FOR EASY MAINTENANCE. PHASE I WILL PROVIDE THE DESIGN FOR THE SYSTEM AND PHASE II WILL INVOLVE THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING OF THE SYSTEM.
