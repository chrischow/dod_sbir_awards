Anomalous Process Awareness and Detection (APAD)-software that will provide cyber security situational awareness for small and medium sized manufacturers
=========================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Wingbrace LLC will deliver a unique cyber situational awareness service and training offering that is specifically targeted at small to medium sized manufacturers who use digital controllers in their manufacturing enterprise. In the United States there are over 250,000 region small manufacturers (those under $50M per year in revenue). A majority of these companies do not have any cyber / information security professionals on their staff – and most of their information technology professionals may be classified as ‘firefighters’ – about the business of making the company assets perform. In Phase 1 of our SBIR, we will architect the Anomalous Process Awareness Detection (APAD) service – a cloud based cyber awareness application that, once configured, will provide both base state analysis of the data traffic of the tenant enterprise. The competitive advantage of our product is that it will deliver improved safety and situational awareness at a lower cost than licensed commercial software alternatives. Our competitive advantage is that we will build our solution ‘cloud ready’ and use next generation machine learning technology to harvest the power of multiple manufacturing companies to ensure that APAD evolves and provides incrementally better service for the IT departments of each member company.Pricing will be at the enterprise – or company – level. A one-time set up (Assessment) fee of
$5,000 for each company will allow the APAD instance to be configured accurately - measuring all external data traffic pertinent to the situational awareness of the ICS enterprise. The set up and recurring fees cover basic service for all APAD related issues. A mobile application will be created for APAD. Wingbrace’s competitive advantage is the scalable, low cost cloud infrastructure that will allow APAD to grow and expand with use. As a ‘consumer driven application’, APAD will be configured – in essence – by the users. Our partner, University of Massachusetts Lowell, will also assist in the training and certification of member companies – and help us cross sell and upsell member companies to new levels of service. We will be the only NIST certified situational awareness application servicing small manufacturers with cyber awareness.
