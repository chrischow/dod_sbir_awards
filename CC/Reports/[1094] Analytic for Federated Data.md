Analytic for Federated Data
===========================

# Abstract


The Analytic for Federated Data (ALFRED) capability was researched under I2WD's SBIR Phase I program in 2017. ALFRED is a general-purpose Machine Learning framework upon which open-source algorithms can be deployed and run. Such algorithms include Recommenders that operate over multi-model Big Data stores to identify and deliver relevant data to mission analysts. The resulting product is a general-purpose framework for industry AND a specific mission capability for I2WD.
