Methods for Determining Threat Level and Intent of Unmanned Aerial Systems
==========================================================================

# Abstract


Spectral Sciences Inc. (SSI) in collaboration with SRC Inc. proposes to develop the Counter UAS Electro-optical Sensor (CUES) to address the need for a compact, low-cost, low-power consumption, tripod-mounted system that can search, detect, identify, track and determine the intent and threat level of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). CUES provides an innovative combination of SSI’s four-dimensional (4D) imager data with SRC’s state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods resulting in a sensor system for detection and tracking that learns how to associate UAS behavior with intent. A 4D optical sensor operating in the shortwave infrared spectral region that simultaneously generates spatial, spectral, and acoustic images will be developed, based on SSI’s proven hyperspectral/hypertemporal imaging technology. The sensor’s multidimensional output will be integrated with deep learning bio-inspired AI data processing algorithms for analysis. The unique combination of capabilities will allow rapid target acquisition followed by on-board processing of large amounts of multidimensional data leading to quick decision-making on the intent and threat level of the monitored UAS.
