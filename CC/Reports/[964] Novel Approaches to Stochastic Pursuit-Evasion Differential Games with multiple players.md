Novel Approaches to Stochastic Pursuit-Evasion Differential Games with multiple players
=======================================================================================

# Abstract


In the phase 1 effort, IAI and its subcontractor, Prof. Jose B. Cruz of the Ohio State University (OSU), have proposed to systemically explore differential pursuit-evasion games with multiple pursuers and evaders. Our Phase I results have shown the theoretical possibility of rigorous formulation, analysis and solutions for stochastic differential Pursuit-evasion games involving multiple pursuers and evaders. The systematic approach enables us to connect this novel approach to the existing theories in pursuit-evasion games and general dynamic games. Up to now, step by step we have extended the existing theory on deterministic PE games with single purser and single evader to more a general game problem involving multiple players under uncertainty. However, in each step the problem can be further investigated in more theoretical depth. On the other hand, it is clear that stochastic pursuit-evasion game problem spans a wide range covering various fields in optimal control, dynamic game, filtering, tracking, artificial intelligence and cooperative control.  Our Primary Phase II objective is to synthesize the newly proposed multiple players stochastic game theorems with the existing theories to create an efficient computational package for practical problems.
