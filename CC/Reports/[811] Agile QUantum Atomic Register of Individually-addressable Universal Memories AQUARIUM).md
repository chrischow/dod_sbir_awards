# Abstract


The realization of quantum networks as a “quantum internet” represent a huge leap in technological capability and computing power. Linking computers over conventional “classical” networks enhances computational power by distributing processing tasks by exchanging data bits and then aggregating the results. For a quantum network, quantum bits or “qubits”) replace classical bits and introduce the potential for perfectly-secure data transfer of information between classical computers and the possibility of exponentially-increased computational power when networking multiple quantum computers. The first quantum network will consist of a series of nodes connected by quantum channels, however the lack of availability of key components—such as quantum memory units—present a technological roadblock to this implementation. Qubits can be implemented in either atomic or photonic quantum states. Photons are ideal for transmitting the quantum information but are difficult to store. Conversely, qubits in isolated atomic systems exhibit long storage times, but offer only limited transmission to the chip or tabletop scale. To enable the transfer of quantum information over an existing telecommunications-fiber network, the first quantum random access memory unit will be implemented. This memory will controllably transfer quantum information from photons to atoms and back to photons following a scalable architecture with high throughput. In Phase I, a single quantum memory unit will be demonstrated with a bandwidth, fidelity, and efficiency compatible with large-scale quantum networking applications. The design will follow a scalable photonic architecture for implementation of multiple registers in Phase II. A successful quantum memory will enable the first quantum networks to link multiple classical computers over a fundamentally secure communication lines. These links will have immediate impacts on national security and financial sectors where communications security is critical. Creating quantum networks will allow the United States to catch up with foreign countries such as China) that already have established operational quantum communication systems. A larger benefit to research, business, and society as a whole will likely be seen when multiple quantum computers are realized and linked using a quantum network. Cooperative communication of quantum computers communicating over the quantum network enables a single, larger computer with more qubits and enables exponential increase in computational power. These computational increases can perform quantum simulations that may speed up drug discovery, improve weather forecasting and climate change predictions, as well as benefit the development of artificial intelligence.
