Battlefield Information Warfare via Distributed Artificial Intelligence
=======================================================================

# Abstract


All modern military and commercial organizations rely heavily upon  information processed with networked computers.  In the commercial  world, protection of this information from electronic espionage has  become essential.  In the military environment, information defense,  exploitation, and attack are becoming important components of warfare.   There is a national need to come to terms with Information Warfare (IW) by  developing advanced battlefield technology that can be used both for  protecting and attacking information.  ORINCON and Kaman Sciences Corporation propose the development of  an Information Warfare system that combines Distributed Intelligent  Agents (DIAs) with the leading intrusion detection tool, Ice-Pick.  The  system, called Multi-Agent Information Vulnerability Exploitation System  (MAIVES), uses Ice-Pick's ability to identify vulnerabilities and distributes  network penetrations using ORINCON's DIA technology.  MAIVES will  permit distributed, coordinated attacks on network systems as well as  assessment of vulnerabilities and planning of defensive tactics at multiple  levels of information flow for the links and processing nodes of C4I and  similar tactical broadcast systems.   MAIVES facilitates continuing upgrades as new vulnerabilities and new  systems are encountered.  In addition, it will accept products and data  obtained by other information system sources (spin-on), thus keeping  current as new information becomes available.  This powerful system  provides tremendous potential for spin-off to other sectors, including  commercial and other government.
