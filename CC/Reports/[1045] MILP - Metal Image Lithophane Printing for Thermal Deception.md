MILP: Metal Image Lithophane Printing for Thermal Deception
===========================================================

# Abstract


The Army currently needs a method of generating thermal decoys that can be used for tricking unmanned aerial vehicles. Current technology allows for targets such as buildings, tanks, and jeeps to be identified based on their thermal signatures and attacked from the sky by artificially intelligent controlled drones. To defend against this, the Army requires the ability to trick these drones into attacking fake decoy targets, expending their munitions, and protecting real military targets. In this proposal Nokomis will detail its plan to design a thermal decoy system based on technology known as MILP (Metal Image Lithophane Printing). This technology will allow for the generation of photographic quality infrared signatures that appear completely realistic while being lightweight, foldable, and easily transported.
