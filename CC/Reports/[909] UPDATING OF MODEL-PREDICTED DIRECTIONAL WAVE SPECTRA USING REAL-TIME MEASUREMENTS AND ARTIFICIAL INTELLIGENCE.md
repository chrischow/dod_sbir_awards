UPDATING OF MODEL-PREDICTED DIRECTIONAL WAVE SPECTRA USING REAL-TIME MEASUREMENTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
=============================================================================================================

# Abstract


AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO UPDATING THEORECTICAL MODEL-PREDICTED DIRECTIONAL WAVE SPECTRA USING REAL-TIME AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONCEPTS IS PROPOSED. CURRENT NUMERICAL WAVE FORECAST MODEL DO NOT UTILIZE REAL-TIME MEASUREMENTS FROM SHIP REPORTS, WAVE BUOYS AND SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING DATA AS INPUTS TO UPDATE ITS FORECAST. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP A COHERENT METHODOLOGY TO RECREATE DIRECTIONAL WAVE SPECTRA BASED ON AGGREGATE OR IMPERFECT MEASUREMENTS FOR UPDATING MODEL PREDICTED DIRECTIONAL WAVE SPECTRA.
