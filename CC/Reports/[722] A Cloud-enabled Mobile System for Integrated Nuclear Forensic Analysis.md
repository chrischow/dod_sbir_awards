A Cloud-enabled Mobile System for Integrated Nuclear Forensic Analysis
======================================================================

# Abstract


Nuclear forensic analysis (NFA) is a complex multi-level process that requires detailed data collection, record keeping, and data exchange management throughout an investigation lifecycle. Currently, forensic data are mostly collected manually using paper forms and forensic digital records that are kept in various spreadsheets or data formats. There are no integrated data standards to ensure the quality and accuracy of forensic data collection, nor is there a data interoperability model to enable timely and convenient data exchange among multiple parties involved in an investigation, resulting in potential delays and high labor costs in producing quality forensic findings. To help the nuclear forensics community with meeting the data challenge, D-Tech, LLC proposes the design and development of a cloud-enabled mobile system as an “Electronic Nuclear Forensic Recordbook” to support integrated nuclear forensic data collection, exchange and analysis. We will leverage the latest mobile, cloud computing, and advanced data analytics technologies to assist nuclear forensics analysts and investigators with convenient data entry, reporting and decision support throughout an investigation lifecycle. Our Phase I effort will focus on 1) conducting a comprehensive survey of the latest data processing technologies and practices in NFA for establishing a R&D baseline, 2) developing an initial data interoperability model called Nuclear Forensic Data Exchange Model (NFDEM) in compliance with the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) standard, and 3) performing a software architecture design of the proposed system with advanced data analytics functions. A standard data interoperability model such as NFDEM will enable close coordination and collaboration among members of the nuclear forensics community, establish direct machine-to- machine data exchange, and provide forensic automation capabilities to accelerate NFA processes. D-Tech has assembled a top-notch technical team for this SBIR, composed of experienced software engineers and system architects, as well as subject matter experts (SMEs) in nuclear forensics, committed to the project success. We will use open source software in our design, and identify the best combination of software and hardware components for nuclear forensic operations. In addition, we plan to develop a prototype of the proposed system to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of our solution. We will work closely with our DOE program management at the Office of Nuclear Denotation Detection (NDD) to identify NFA data challenges, and reach out to members of the nuclear forensics community including the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) in DHS, FBI, the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA), the National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST), and the National Labs in developing and promoting the proposed data interoperability model and analytics solution.
