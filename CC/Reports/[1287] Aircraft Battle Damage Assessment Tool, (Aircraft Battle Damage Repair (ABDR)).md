Aircraft Battle Damage Assessment Tool, (Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR))
==============================================================================

# Abstract


The capability to quickly assess and restore a damaged aircraft to a useful level of combat capability is vital to the United States Air Force. Open Solutions, Inc. proposes to develop a decision support system that makes use of airframe properties (impact location, load factor) and structural failure mode to assist Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) teams in this process. This tool will enhance the ABDR team's ability to evaluate battle damage and develop  feasible repair options and procedures, especially during war-time.  It could also serve as a valuable tool for training.   The proposed system will enhance existing ABDR support tools, and provide the ABDR sustainment community an intelligent simulator for analysis. Artificial intelligence and data mining techniques will be employed to mine knowledge from historic data repositories. Structural and dynamic load factors will also be considered. The underlying model will be based on heuristic and probabilistic theories. Historic data will be used to test, verify, and validate the model. This prototype system will also identify application infrastructure delivery issues including deployment communications, and system availability. Phase I will produce a limited prototype system to demonstrate the proof of concept. A more robust prototype will be delivered in Phase II.
