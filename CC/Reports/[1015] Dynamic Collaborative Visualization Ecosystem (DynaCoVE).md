Dynamic Collaborative Visualization Ecosystem (DynaCoVE)
========================================================

# Abstract


There is no one display device that is ideally suited for visualizing non-spatial, 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D data. For this reason, a visualization ecosystem that unifies many components from the fields of scientific visualization, infovis, data analytics, big data, and display technologies is needed. This new tool will enable interactive scientific visualization across many different 2D, 2.5D and 3D display devices. The framework must be user and data centric. This will be accomplished via meta-data categorization to automatically establish a suite of algorithms and technologies that are suitable for the data, user, and display hardware at hand. In addition, the framework must remain algorithm and display technology agnostic. This will be done via a consistent interactive meta-visualization graph used across all devices. The system will abstract out cumbersome details such as format conversion and load balancing away from users to allow them to focus on visualizing their data. The new tool will be demonstrated on the many 2D, 2.5D, and 3D display devices in the Wright State University Appenzeller Visualization Laboratory. Test cases for the proof-of-concept will include interactive visualizations capturing 3D data on immersive displays with support from infovis methods on 2D displays.
