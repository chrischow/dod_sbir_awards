Futures Emergency Management through Artificial Intelligence
============================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is to develop the Intelligent Detection of Human-generated Threats (IDEHT) system, which will use artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to detect emerging human-generated physical threats to Army installations by monitoring open source and security-related data sets. Our innovative approach includes analyzing potentially threatening individuals and groups of individuals in the context of their overall networks of relationships across disparate data sources, using advanced artificial intelligence methods to learn to automatically detect patterns of threatening behavior in the data, and alerting emergency management personnel to identified threats with supporting evidence and analysis that is designed to facilitate immediate action to address the threat. . Our innovative technical approach employs the following key elements: IDEHT fuses data from open source digital media sources and from security-related data sources; deep machine learning methods are able to learn from user-supplied feedback, allowing IDEHT to continually improve threat detection performance; network analysis, semantic analysis, and intuitive visualizations are used to support EM personnelâ€™s deeper understanding of the threat, so that a rapid and effective response may be carried out. Threats are presented to EM personnel via real-time alerts so that timely response is assured.
