Near Real-time LIDAR Processing and Exploitation Algorithms
===========================================================

# Abstract


The increasing commonality of airborne lidar sensors producing high volumes of data for surveillance and reconnaissance missions has resulted in the need for robust, rapid, and autonomous 3D point cloud data exploitation algorithms.A variety of techniques have been proposed to meet the challenges of 3D data object detection and aided or automatic target recognition (AiTR/ATR) and each offers different trades with respect to performance and the feasibility of real-time implementation.Aret proposes a real-time lidar point cloud data exploitation framework incorporating (1) point cloud database management for algorithm training and testing, (2) segmentation and classification in 3-dimensions using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, and (3) a scalable, parallel processing architecture optimized for near real-time embedded processing.
