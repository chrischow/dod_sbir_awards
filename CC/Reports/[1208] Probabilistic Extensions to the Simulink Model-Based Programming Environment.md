Probabilistic Extensions to the Simulink Model-Based Programming Environment
============================================================================

# Abstract


Barron Associates proposes to develop, validate, and demonstrate a cohesive set of probabilistic extensions for the model-based programming environment Simulink, developed by The MathWorks, Inc. These extensions will allow developers to model random variables, vectors, and matrices, as well as both discrete and continuous random processes as first-class objects within the Simulink language. Barron Associates will also develop extensions that developers can use to process those random quantities within standard machine learning, signal processing, and feedback control algorithms. These capabilities will be demonstrated in the context of autonomous sensor processing and UAS control. They will be commercialized in the form of a Simulink block library that brings probabilistic programming constructs to a large and commercially active model-based development community.
