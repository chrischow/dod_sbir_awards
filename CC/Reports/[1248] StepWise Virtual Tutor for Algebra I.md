StepWise Virtual Tutor for Algebra I
====================================

# Abstract


StepWise will be a mobile and desktop virtual tutor that provides real-time assessments and support to middle and high school students to learn Algebra. The adaptive engine will include rule-based artificial intelligence to guide students through the steps of solving problems, and will permit students to explore many different pathways to a correct response. After entering a response, students will receive immediate feedback on whether the step is correct, information on why, and hints for what to do next. Through the teacher dashboard, StepWise will aggregate assessment results at the class and individual student level, and provide teachers detailed reports on types and frequency of errors to inform instruction. StepWise will be implemented in and out of classrooms to supplement instruction and learning.
