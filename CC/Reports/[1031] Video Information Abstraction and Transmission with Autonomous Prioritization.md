Video Information Abstraction and Transmission with Autonomous Prioritization
=============================================================================

# Abstract


To address the Army’s need for alternative methods to transmit information in motion imagery or full-motion videos (FMVs) from an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) to a ground control station without a constant link, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (ISI) proposes to develop a new Video Information Abstraction and Transmission with Autonomous Prioritization (VIATAP) system, based on novel integration of deep/machine learning-based video analytics with onboard sensors and communication systems. Specifically, the innovation in a novel video analytics system design and use of multi-level abstracted information representation will enable VIATAP to prioritize and transmit essential reconnaissance and surveillance information without constantly streaming FMVs. As a result, VIATAP offers timely delivery of information over unstable links with significant reduction in bandwidth, transmission time and radio signature, directly addressing the Army requirements. In Phase I, ISI will develop an initial concept and model key elements of VIATAP by performing requirement and methodology analysis, designing system architecture, and develop, document, and evaluate key algorithms to assess the VIATAP feasibility. In Phase II, ISI plans to optimize algorithms and intermittent transmission methods, conduct design reviews, and develop a TRL 4-5 Phase II prototype for evaluation, along with a plan for integration and transition to Phase III.
