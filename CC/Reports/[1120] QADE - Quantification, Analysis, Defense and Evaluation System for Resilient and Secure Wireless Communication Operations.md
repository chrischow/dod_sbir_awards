QADE: Quantification, Analysis, Defense and Evaluation System for Resilient and Secure Wireless Communication Operations
========================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Department of Defense (DoD) operations critically rely upon efficient, robust, resilient and secure wireless network communications. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a key technology to support wireless communications systems in their adaptation to spectrum dynamics including novel adversarial threats. While ML is getting traction in wireless security applications such as detecting conventional attacks (e.g., jamming), little work has been done so far in investigating how vulnerable wireless systems are to ML-based security and privacy attack vectors. Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) propose to mature its Quantification, Analysis, Defense, and Evaluation System (QADE) prototype for secure and resilient wireless communications operations. The key innovations of QADE include integrated environmental awareness, signal detection and classification, sensing data processing, adversarial machine learning attacks and defenses, and implementation on embedded platforms.
