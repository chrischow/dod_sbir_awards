High Fidelity Accelerated Vector Wave Propagation Model with Data Verification and Enhancement in Urban Environments
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


In this proposal, a high fidelity accelerated vector wave propagation model with data verification and enhancement is developed for mmW propagation prediction and rapid generation of complex multipath effects within urban environments. For each propagation mechanism: specular reflection, diffraction, and diffuse scattering, we properly model the polarization behaviors and study their impacts on the multipath effects. Ray tracing is implemented as a deterministic method to model the ray interaction with the urban environments. In order to reduce the computational load of tray tracing process, a sighted object search algorithm, ray path discovery method and sectorized ray path validity check approach are developed to achieve time efficiency. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to exploit the measured data for the purpose of accelerating physic based propagation model while maintaining high accuracy. Spatial and temporal statistics generated from the developed model are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and runtime is estimated for assessing the potential of the proposed model. The software is designed with cross-platform functionality so that it can operate on different host platforms, and make it easier to be compatible with existing Army simulation and scene generation software and tool suites in the future.
