AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT JOB PERFORMANCE AID (AIJPA) FOR ON-BOARD AUDIO TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================================================================

# Abstract


INTERMEDIATE MAINTENANCE IS NORMALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY HIGHLY TRAINED, HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICANS. THE ABILITY TO PLACE SUCH SKILLED PERSONNEL IN "REMOTE-FIELD POSITIONS" HAS BECOME ECONOMICALLY IMPRACTICAL BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FAILURES THAT OCCUR AND THE HIGH COST OF TRAINING. THIS BEING THE CASE, WE MUST LOOK TO STATE-OF-THE-ART ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BRING THE EXPERTISE OF THESE HIGHLY TRAINED TECHNICANS TO THE AID OF THE PERSONNEL CURRENTLY IN THE FIELD. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH THE DESIGN FEASIBILITY OF A STAND-ALONE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT JOB PERFORMANCE AID (AIJPA) FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF INTERMEDIATE MAINTENANCE TASKS. USING THIS AID WOULD ELIMINATE AND ALLOW THIS FUNCTION TO BE PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL TRAINED AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL MAINTENANCE LEVEL.
