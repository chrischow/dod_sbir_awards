        "Abstract": "The United States Navys radar systems provide essential missions in contested environments spanning from long range air surveillance to air marshalling and weapons queuing. Performance and affordability of these radars is paramount. Performance encompasses the inherent ability to execute the mission and overcoming sophisticated threats and adversarial tactics: technical capability and system availability. Affordability encompasses all elements of life-cycle costTotal Ownership Cost (TOC): development, acquisition, operation and long-term sustainment expenses. The P-8A based littoral, maritime and land, marshalling and surveillance radar is essential to the Navys mission. A Cognitive Airborne Radar for Surveillance (CARS) solution enabled by modern architecture techniques and technologies will advance the capabilities of the P-8A mission through extreme adaptability and justify the cost of a new, advanced system architecture that supports radar with interferometry and Electronic Warfare (EW). Colorado Engineering, Inc. (CEI) developed advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), radar, EW and architecture techniques, along with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies, will be leveraged on CARS."

        "Abstract": "To reduce the false positive and false negative detection and identification of submarines, Nokomis proposes to build an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm suite, in conjunction with its ultra-sensitive signal detection capability, to minimize the in-band interferences on existing airborne anti-submarine warfare (ASW) systems.To minimize the background noise and interference, the signal sources in underwater acoustic signals will be isolated. In addition to this, in some environmental conditions a submarine could hide between layers of different temperatures or different salt concentrations that greatly influence the sound propagation and make the target even harder to detect. In a shallow-water archipelago, these problems are further compounded by strong reverberation effects, caused by sound reflection from the sea floor, the surface, and islands, which lead to subsequent interference phenomena.The proposed technique includes three major steps. The first step is to remove the random noise by wavelet based denoising processing. The second step is to enhance the contrast of signal source of interest from acoustic signal. The third step is to isolate the signal sources of interest from acquired acoustic signal. The third step involves feature extraction processing, waveform matching processing, and AI based deep learning processing."

The result will be a system that integrates with existing AOC tools and enhances decision making in the AOC by filtering, searching, and synthesizing heterogeneous data, operating both proactively in the background and providing assistance on demand. The objective is to augment existing tools by offering tailored assistance to operators for tasks that are time-sensitive, data-intensive, recurring, or otherwise challenging, via a user interface that reduces operator workload.During Phase I, the proposal team will conduct a feasibility study that includes: identifying candidate tasks to be performed by the assistant; defining how AOC-ASSIST will integrate with existing systems and processes; and identifying technologies that will complete the required tasks."

Analysis, Discovery, and Mining of Unstructured and Multilingual Information and Intelligence (ADAM) will allow for the efficient processing and mining of two of the greatest challenges facing intelligence operators today: 1) unstructured information in the form of text, graphics, and images 2) processing and analyzing multilingual intelligence information in low-connectivity environments and low-resource languages. This proposal will investigate using Plasticitys prior state-of-the-art work in natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to create novel algorithms for text analytics, classification, and information extraction that can be used for intelligence and surveillance use cases. Many state-of-the-art approaches will be researched and evaluated for their adeptness at these tasks. Furthermore, this proposal will develop a technical feasibility study to be completed at the end of Phase I to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADAM system and algorithms in improving the efficiency and scope intelligence analysts operate on and improving situational awareness."

Awayr analyzes interface designs to accurately predict distraction, and the elements responsible. Awayr is presently developed for civilian semi-autonomous automotive interface. This innovative expert system has strong potential in defense-related domains, especially unmanned aerial systems (UASs). The present effort will explore the adaptation of Awayr to face DOD customers. We will consider Awayrs application to human machine interface (HMI), which UAV operators use to command and control unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assets. Awayr can potentially model and improve human-machine teaming a) between artificially intelligent autonomous systems and an individual expert human operator (1-1), b) between an operator and a swarm (1-n), and c) in fully distributed human-machine systems (n-1). We will also consider Awayrs technology for real-time state detection and response systems, toward UAV interface which form responsive real-time teams with human operators, rapidly directing attention to appropriate channels. Both feasibility evaluations will focus on USAF Priorities for the present SBIR, as well as cross-benefit to our commercial product. The goal: a dual-purpose expert system for optimized human-machine teaming, increasing mission success for the warfighter and on-road safety for the civilian population."

        "Abstract": "Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) workflows do not effectively or comprehensively consider the potentially negative impacts of physical and cognitive degradation on human analysts performance. This is particularly true when analysts experience negative effects from fatigue or burnout, which they are unlikely to self-report. Occupational stress can impact quality-of- life, physiological function, and is associated with alteration in performance. S.A.Wyze has developed a biosensor platform that is well-suited to achieving this goal. S.A.Wyze will develop a specific product form that uses a Biopsychosocial Approach to Real-Time Health Monitoring for early detection of physical and cognitive degradation in ISR operators. This secured solution will utilize novel integrated technologies to create a holistic, personalized profile that includes physiological data from novel on-body biosensors,environmental and psychological data from mobile application inputs, social behavior data from social media accounts that feeds into cloud-based artificial intelligence engine."

        "Abstract": "To achieve high accuracy, free space optical communication (FSOC) propagation modeling and analysis for various battlespace scenarios, Intelligent Fusion Technology, Inc. (IFT) and its university partner University of North Florida, propose to develop a tool-chain based FSOC coverage analysis and prediction platform by using software-in-the-loop (SITL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) algorithms. A high fidelity physical FSOC propagation model with artificial intelligent based data verification and enhancement is implemented in the central processor of the proposed platform. The physics based model will be developed by identifying and analyzing all possible factors including absorption, scattering, weather conditions, beam divergence, and atmospheric turbulence. An advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is then applied to verify and enhance the accuracy of prediction. Besides the central processor, the proposed platform also consists of a developed front end with real-time human-machine interaction, a designed compendium of all the identified factors that can affect the FSOC propagation, and multiple available databases that are integrated to acquire corresponding datasets. The proposed solution has significant advantages in terms of high-fidelity prediction accuracy, scalability, time efficiency, and low cost."

        "Abstract": "To meet the demands of the AF182-041 SBIR solicitation (Militarized Direct RF Conversion Software Defined Radio (SDR)), MaXentric proposes an open source architecture SDR that leverages COTS components coupled with MaXentrics DSP algorithms. The design uses a direct conversion architecture to digitize the RF spectrum at the antenna. This results in an SDR that can analyze the entire EM environment opening new possibilities in terms of intelligent frequency flexible communication. For example, users could scan the EM spectrum and set the radio to transmit on the least crowded band. Furthermore, the proposed design forms the foundation for radically improved radios which leverage artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize spectrum reuse and combat friendly\/hostile jamming. The final proposed system will be ruggedized, radiation hardened, electromagnetic pulse resistant and cyber secure. In Phase I, MaXentric will perform a study involving analysis, modeling, simulation, and experimentation to design and estimate the performance of the proposed SDR. During Phase II, the proposed SDR will be fabricated and tested using military waveforms."

Our mission is to help our customers deploy a broad range of autonomous systems faster, more safely, and for a fraction of the cost compared to current approaches.Our technology automatically generates massive simulation worlds where its safe to learn from mistakes. These environments are used to expose autonomous systems to the millions of miles and scenarios that they must encounter during development, training, and testing. Real-world training at this scale is not only prohibitively slow and expensive, it can be extremely dangerous. For systems that need to deploy in locations with limited access or hypothetical scenarios, real-world data may be impossible to obtain.We currently offer a range of products from pre-configured virtual environments up to enterprise software solutions for generating new virtual worlds on the fly. Most of our customers are consumer automotive companies building a full-stack autonomous vehicle effort. These customers are traditionally focused on simulation in developed areas across the United States, but Parallel Domain can work with defense and government customers to simulate rural areas or other geographic locations."

However, these AF security personnel are responsible for operating and tracking a number of security systems, which can be distracting from X-ray image interpretation. Scanning image interpretation is a time consuming and specialized skill requiring training processes inconsistent with Security Forces rotation schedule.Finally, assessing X-ray images requires security personnel to be at the systems and close to potential IEDs and attackers, putting soldiers at risk and limiting their mission flexibility. Synapse will augment its existing Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning technology, Syntech ONE (SAFETY Act DT&amp;E certified), which uses computer vision techniques to automatically detect weapons and IEDs.The Synapse technology will be deployable on legacy AF ECP X-ray machines.The automatic detection capabilities will improve detection and allow AF operators to more efficiently and safely manage ECP operations."

        "Abstract": "The Air Force requires the continuous training and development of pilots to maintain combat readiness over a variety of aircraft types. Assessment of pilot development and readiness during training involves various performance metrics as well as biometrics, which currently includes eye tracking. However, we believe further biometric assessments in real time can aid instructors and artificial intelligence-based adaptive learning platforms in better predictive assessment of pilots and faster training. Zansors has developed the next-generation wearable breathing sensor that can provide enriched biometric data on breathing patterns and movement, with current validated applications to sleep quality and athletic performance. We propose a proof-of-concept application of Zansors wearable technology to enhance and improve pilot training and performance assessment. Our technology, designed and manufactured in the USA, can enhance individual assessments through breathing and movement patterns during different training situations to assess and provide biofeedback, and help quicken and improve the pilot training process."

Hyperion can be an immediate and substantial force multiplier to all C3I&amp;N missions by using non-traditional data sources, artificial intelligence (AI), and shifting the traditional focus on current activities to one that uses future forecasts of the operational environment.The Hyperion risk and threat assessment platform integrates layers of unclassified data and algorithms to aggregate, categorize, and ingest open source data such as RSS, news feeds, and social media. Hyperions AI analyzes the content of data feeds, calculates stability, makes forecasts, and builds summaries to display global events that impact risk and stability levels. This provides analysts with a powerful tool and an Application Programming Interface (API) that is easily integrated into GCSS-AF and other C3I&amp;N systems.Hyperion addresses key aspects of the Pitch Day in C3I&amp;N BAA, specifically the ability to use commercial AI\/ML data exploitation to automatically extract valuable information from massive, multimodal, dynamic data, and ingesting large volumes of data that are not routinely used across the enterprise."

        "Abstract": "The objective of this project is to design, develop, and demonstrate intelligent algorithms for combat casualty care embedded in a small, low cost, high-performance, open architecture computer system.In this project we focus on critical interventions in treatment of combat casualties, specifically hemorrhage control and airway management. In related work MDC is developing tools for combat casualty care (CCC), including a novel tool for semi-automated vascular access (AVAD), an automated tool for airway restoration and emergency resuscitation (EO2), and an automated tourniquet system (ATS) for managing hemorrhage from one or more limbs on one or more patients (e.g., in a mass casualty event). Developing an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to support, and eventually to automate, the use of these and related trauma care tools at various levels of CCC will have important impacts on military and civilian trauma care. The AVAD, ATS, and EO2 tools we consider in Phase 1 enable interventions to address the two leading causes of preventable combat deaths: severe (non-compressible or compressible) hemorrhage and airway obstructions. Successful AI guided interventions with these tools and others for CCC can save many lives, both military and civilian."

        "Abstract": "To address the Armys need for an Artificial-Intelligence-based Automated Fire Control System, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Aggressive AI Self-Learning Defense Network (ASSAILNET) technology. Specifically, the innovation in the network architecture, the network node interface design, and the network training strategy will enable each AI node in the network to interface seamlessly with a wide range of attached sensors, to share its sensor data with other nodes, to correlate shared data from other nodes with its own data, and then, together with other nodes, make coordinated collective decisions and, as a whole network, stage concerted effective actions to mitigate identified threats. As a result, this technology offers a solution to provide fire control awareness to weapons and other systems, which directly addresses the Army requirements for an AI-based Automated Fire Control System (AFCS). In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology and provide a detailed engineering design study that explains how the new technology will lead to an AI system that operates the AFCS. In Phase II, POC plans to complete the software\/algorithm, update the source code, and demonstrate an AI prototype in the laboratory."

        "Abstract": "The problem of pest bird control is a thorny one for wildlife managers. A useful tool for controlling the numbers of pest birds is egg oiling, a method to render eggs non-viable, but prior use was restricted to ground nesting species. Common ravens are serious pests of agriculture and attack many threatened and endangered species but nest in locations out of reach from the ground. Three years of development work on remote oiling of ravens eggs by team partner Hardshell Labs has resulted in a drone system capable of reaching all raven nests, including in electrical transmission towers. BWCS has worked extensively on artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of recognizing a variety of natural objects and organisms. We will join forces to create a remote egg-oiling (REO) drone capable of autonomously navigating to electrical tower raven nests, transmitting images of the nest to an operator on the ground and, when triggered, to deliver a stream of oil accurately to the eggs. The addition of AI technology to the REO drone promises to greatly expand the use of the method by wildlife managers and utilities as it will lower the barriers to its use by a wide array of field personnel."

As intelligence systems grow, their SWaP grows to an unmanageable point, due inherent inefficiencies in using conventional Complementary metaloxidesemiconductor (CMOS) based general purpose processors or AI accelerators like GPUs. Although, photonic AI accelerators have been attempted, the current approaches are lacking and are unable to operate at light speed due to numerous conversions back and forth between electrical and photonic domain, to enable non-linear activation. GenXComm technology enables photonic AI accelerators to which are low power, high throughput, and operate purely in the optical domain, enabling operation at light speed, with a SWaP enabling deployment on small Airborne platforms."

        "Abstract": "AvaWatzs SOPHIA is an artificial intelligence (AI) based Analytics and interactive Visualization software that reduces the cognitive burden on intelligence analysts tasked with interpreting large volumes of complex Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) data. The ability to collect ISR data has far outpaced the ability to understand it. Technology has greatly amplified our capacity to collect raw facts, but it has not made equal progress in assisting our understanding of those facts. While we can accumulate vast quantities of observations, it is still the responsibility of human analysts to attach meaning to those observations, to find patterns and connections that bind events together into narratives, and to select the rare scenarios with tactical or strategic significance. Cognitive overload, due to natural limits on human attention and perception, is the principal bottleneck that SOPHIA solves to fully exploit intelligence collection. SOPHIAs Analytics and Visualization components treat connected data elements, such as sequences and narratives, as the basic units of data to be analyzed and displayed, and semantic features are used to assist the analysts sensemaking process. SOPHIA uses a unique blend of machine learning, reasoning and reinforcement models that sharpen its results and reduces its rate of false positives."

        "Abstract": "Multi-domain command and control (MDC2) requires an efficient and effective capability to perform cross-domain effects synchronizationfor example, coordinating a planned air strike mission from one operation center around an ongoing cyber mission from another.We propose to build Effects Explorer, which combines an intuitive interface with state-of-the-art data analysis to accelerate effects synchronization across air, cyber, and space domains.Effects Explorer will integrate and customize C2Core and Solr to search across domains, data types, and command centers; display the results in a format familiar to operations center personnel and integrate the search results with the existing software; and apply artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to suggest relevant searches and to quickly filter results. C2Core is a family of software applications operational worldwide at U.S. Air Force AOCs and used by coalition partners. Solr is a widely used open source enterprise search platform. Effects Explorer will leverage these two systems to enable strategy, planning, and execution personnel to visualize and synchronize cross-domain effects in an accurate and timely manner.During Phase II, the proposal team will: refine the requirements and design, develop the software in agile cycles, evaluate the system with end-users, and address transition requirements."

The initial focus was on robotics and autonomous systems, but Raven[Ops] found a larger need to aggregate perception-class data in a variety of other contexts from the intelligence community to Air Operations Centers.For the Air Force to remain competitive in artificial intelligence and to maximize the use of data from different sources, it will need the ability to recover, organize, search, and access perception class data provided by a PDMS."

It is ultimately necessary to develop a mission planner decision aid that enables Automated Decision Support (ADS) utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Leaning (ML) to provide timely and effective employment of maritime resources. To address this need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to design and develop an AEGIS weapon system-compliant AI-based COA software tool to improve the Navys 3-phase mission planning capability. ACT will provide automated situational awareness analysis, deep learning-trained COA decision making, and adversarial reasoning-based COA evaluation as key enablers for near real-time antifragile mission planning."

        "Abstract": "Threats of malicious activity exist today not only on the internet and within business networks, but also within the industrial control system (ICS) realm which is critical to our national infrastructure. ICSs are typically used in industries such as electric, water and wastewater, oil and natural gas, transportation, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and discrete manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, and durable goods). Within the computing industry, cybersecurity tools on the market today are largely structured to detect known bad entities (malware, viruses, etc). Adversaries are generating malware and finding new vulnerabilities faster than security software companies can respond; the approach today is very much based on prevention by securing systems using best practices and tools for detection of known threats. The detection methods search for known bad signatures. However, using advanced computing capabilities such as automated machine learning, it is possible to develop methods for identifying previously unknown threats and to potentially stop unknown malware before it impacts system functionality. To detect unregistered threats, that is threats that have not been identified previously, a new paradigm for the basis of detection is proposed in this research. This technology has broad applicability to address cyber issues and beyond."

However, significant modeling choices must still be made in trying to achieve answers accurate enough for engineering decisions, but without unwarranted computational effort. This is especially true for high value complex submarine hull structures that are needed to protect Navy warfighters and enable successful missions. Using a rational series of models of varying fidelity, M4 Engineering will develop a comprehensive design guide of best practices and their temporal and spatial regions of applicability that can be utilized by the Navy and its contractors during their design and analysis activities. A comprehensive manual set giving specifications that will standardize submarine hull structure modeling best practices will be created. Artificial intelligence methods will be used to create a complementary software tool to provide an automated means for giving detailed modeling recommendations for specific designs. The design recommendations and the process for developing them will be validated via a companion experimental program that will be planned fully during Phase II for execution during Phase III."

In both of these applications it is valuable to have access to highly skilled automated actors. In a decision support context, this facilitates fast, high fidelity simulations with a variety of possible battlefield conditions. In a training context, this supports interactive learning tools and allows commanders to hone their skills through competition with difficult opponents.Historically, Artificial Intelligence agents that can match or beat expert human performance have been limited to turn-based games. However, due to the success of IBMs Deep Blue system at Chess, and more recently, DeepMinds AlphaGo system at Go, the latest research has begun to investigate if the techniques employed by these systems can be improved to achieve expert-level performance at less well-defined, real-time games.To manage the fundamental complexities that military-domain AI systems face, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation proposes the Framework for Intelligent Simulation Command with Hierarchically Embedded Reinforcement Learning (FISCHER). FISCHER will leverage the latest developments in Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning to provide a wargaming artificial intelligence that can perform at a humanlike level."

        "Abstract": "A comprehensive technical training software platform combining computer visionand Augmented Reality (AR) technologies can transform the human learningprocess and experience. Computer vision is leveraged to understand the physicalenvironment, while AR is used to superimpose contextual information onto thephysical world. We aim to provide software solution using AR tools and systemsto address specific challenges in technical training of physical systems. Onechallenge with existing AR software platforms is failure of recognizing complexsystems or objects that have small, shiny, or textureless components. In thisSTTR Phase I proposal, we propose to develop specific machine learningalgorithms that can be integrated with state-of-the-art AR technology, to enhanceautomatic object and component recognition and display automatic annotations via AR. With the capability of recognizing components more reliable, accurate,cheaper and faster, the developed machine learning algorithms can improvetechnical training efficiency on complex physical systems using existing ARapplication platform. Focus area: FA-002 Artificial Intelligence (AI)."

        "Abstract": "The focus of this proposal is FA-002 - artificial intelligence (AI), which will be used for the hardware cyber security. AI will link the THz and sub-THz responses at the pins to the defects and deviations from design of the integrated circuits under test. An increasing complexity of digital and mixed-signal systems makes establishing the authenticity of a chip to be a key problem. New rapid, inexpensive, and non-destructive technology is needed to address this problem. We will develop a new terahertz AI testing technique for non-destructive identification of genuine integrated circuits, even in-situ and even under bias, by measuring their response to terahertz and\/or sub-terahertz radiation at the circuit pins and using AI algorithms for the response classification and interpretation. A big advantage of this new technique compared to other radiation enhanced testing is that this new approach does not affect the device operation. In contrast to the conventional THz imaging, this technique will use the intensity, polarization, frequency, and bias dependences of the THz response at the VLSI or MMIC pins. Our recent results demonstrated that this technique allowed for the unambiguous identification of the MMIC defective transistors."

Our technology, called EMERALD (Explainable Machine Reasoning through the Application of Linked Data), is designed to improve trust and transparency within human-in-the-loop AI systems by providing the human operator with an informed basis for accepting\/rejecting\/modifying the decisions of the AI. EMERALD works by leveraging background information contained within knowledge graphs to infer an AIs internal model of the world based on its external behaviors. EMERALD is designed to take advantage of ever-increasing volumes of structured semantic information (linked data) available on the Web. The recent proliferation of explicitly structured Semantic Web data (two prominent examples being Wikidata and the Google Knowledge Graph) has occurred at the same time as powerful black box machine learning algorithms such as DNNs have become ubiquitous. Because these algorithms often encode information implicitly, their thought processes defy easy interpretation. With EMERALD, we will capitalize on one AI trend (knowledge graphs) to improve the transparency and trustworthiness of another (machine learning). As such, our approach resides at the vanguard of so-called third-wave contextual AI Research."

UbiHeres commercial system is comprised of an application specific electronics tag, designed by the company, which utilizes a suite of high precision commercial sensors to provide real-time data to an onboard machine learning and artificial intelligence software system. This location and tracking tag solution accesses on-board or network accessible high fidelity geo-registered digital datasets to process, analyze, learn and correct the movement information provided by the sensors to refine and correct the position of the tag to a true location comparable to that provided by GPS systems. Given the technologys unique combination of low-cost, high-accuracy, long battery life and operational capability, the UbiHere system has the potential to transform the Air Forces ability to operate effectively in any GPS denied environment. The system has been tested for indoor commercial applications but has the potential to provide outdoor location and tracking of vehicles, Airmen and other assets in GPS contested environments. This is particularly true for Air Force special"

        "Abstract": "Effective mission planning is critical for military strategy and execution. This process is complex as human operators must consider many variables (e.g., resource limitations, threats, risks) when formulating a plan to accomplish mission goals. Although powerful tools, such as the Navys Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), provide advanced functionality, mission planning remains a hybrid activity across human operators and mission planning tools. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can facilitate an improved mission planning process. To effectively integrate these technologies into mission planning, we propose to design and demonstrate Joint User-centered Planning artificial Intelligence Tools for Effective mission Reasoning (JUPITER), an AI-based mission planning framework founded on joint cognitive system principles united with an advanced library of AI\/ML capabilities for effective and efficient mission planning. We will identify opportunities for AI methods to support the mission planning process, such as by overcoming individual bias, discovering hidden alternatives, offloading extensive manual processing and analysis of low-level information, and incorporating historical and contextual information. JUPITER will use a joint cognitive system (JCS) approach to uniquely frame human operator and AI as a single unit, enabling human-AI teams to jointly collaborate and address the challenging and complex mission planning process."

Existing and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are well-suited to assisting humans with these challenges. While the promise of AI\/ML is great, there are significant obstacles to operationalizing AI and ML technologies for this problem, both from a technical perspective and from a human perspective. Perceptronics Solutions proposes to provide PMA-281 with our innovative solution: The Multi-Model Optimization Process (MMOP) for high impact AI\/ML insertion. The MMOP system is designed to integrate a sequential set of computational and data science models that can determine where to best apply AI to improve the JMPS and subsequent mission planning process. The system generates the places where AI\/ML can make the planning more efficient, lead to better outcomes and be likely to succeed by analyzing: (1) importance of a particular decision or activity is to the overall planning outcome; (2) where the system architecture and available data will make the implementation of AI\/ML feasible; and (3) where it is likely AI\/ML can be created to be better in critical dimensions than human decision-making."

REVAMP will improve the next generation of Mission Planning Systems (MPS) by providing automated mission planning and performance verification capabilities. It will close the gap between state-of-the-art data-based techniques and the currently used mission planning processes to increase reliability and speed, while reducing operational costs and the cognitive burden imposed on planners and pilots.

Based on our previous work in security of embedded systems, we propose a scalable architecture for vulnerabilities assessment and penetration tests. It is based on adaptive hardware using latest FPGA and Systems on a Chip technologies and a standard software architecture, to quickly build a broad range of testing systems. The will range from the objective of this solicitation, the RedBox, a small, inexpensive device for vulnerabilities by non-experts, to laboratory systems for vulnerabilities assessment and penetration tests using complex attacks like fault injection or side channels. For the orchestration and sequencing of the assessment tests based on artificial intelligence, we will reuse and extend the results of ObjectSecuritys WhizRT SBIR, which has to goal to develop an intelligent attacker for training purposes.A specific concern of the RedBox device is to support non-expert users during the connection process to the device to test, and the intuitive presentation of the results."

        "Abstract": "The FSTS proposed technology is an important technology step into the future. One of the important features of the proposed AFWERX FSTS SBIR solution is it marries completely with the future. The new Iridium NEXT communications constellation was just completed this year and has a 20 to 30 year expected life. The new constellation has important security; anti jam; satellite timing and location (STL), total global coverage, extremely low latency, and low power consumption ground sensors to communicate from anywhere in the world. McQ has two new commercial sensors it will demonstrate sending target information through Iridium. The proposed SBIR approach removes the large cost and operational difficulty of setting up terrestrial communications by using the global Iridium communications network. Target data is available immediately when sensors are deployed. Secure distribution of situation awareness information is available as soon as a sensor mission begins. This architecture permits very fast Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Fusion processing that can quickly screen large Big Data information. Geo referenced data is then tailored in seconds for reporting to Command Centers and field operators at the edge. Multi source information fusion and AI can provide new advances in ISR information under the proposed concept."

Unfortunately, current capabilities do not successfully address the complex needs of pallet planning. Due to the configuration needs, weight difference, and varying sizes, the selection and assembly process to construct these pallets is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Cougaar Software, Inc. (CSI) proposes developing a Configured Airlift Load Building Tool (CALBT)an Artificial Intelligence enhanced software capability, with automated algorithms and planning tools for palletized cargo to render virtual prototypes of loads for aircraft for assembling them for transportation. CSIs aim is to develop a tool that has (1) high performance optimization engine for determining an optimized load configuration; (2) intuitive and simple user interfaces; (3) an open API allowing other programs or systems to access the loading optimization; and (4) technologies required for determining, capturing, and\/or sensing cargo information, item identification, and cargo and cargo hold dimensions. Findings will provide a tool that significantly reduces airman disabilities and injuries and improves the efficiency of aerial port operations."

        "Abstract": "Advanced data algorithmic techniques are revolutionizing many commercial and military products.These techniques show promise to rapidly improve US missile defense, potentially allowing the integrated BMDS the ability to perform time critical operations more quickly, extract from observational sensor data new discriminating characteristics that allow identification of threat and threat features, predict the likely occurrence of an event or weapon intent, and improve resiliency to intentional or unintentional surprise during mission execution. A unique source for these analytical innovations lies in work Arete has conducted for the Intelligence Community, where analytical techniques commonly address subtle target situations to extract key information.Proven sensor fusion, artificial intelligence, and detection algorithms can be adapted to apply to the BMDS.Data to prove algorithmic efficacy is readily available from the investment that the US has made in Missile Defense testing.Terabytes of sensor test data are available from previous MDA missions, which may unlock valuable new and improved performance from existing sensors and systems. This project explores data analysis to show the value and application of data methods to improve BMDS performance.Aret will investigate capabilities using MDA test data, applying adapted data algorithms and methodologies to form a kernel of capabilities.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "Abstract": "The Air Mobility Command (AMC) is responsible for shipping approved air cargo anywhere in the world at a moments notice to support warfighter requirements. In order to meet this need, airmen must be able to rapidly, effectively, and efficiently palletize cargo, frequently on 463L pallets, to prepare them for shipping. However, due to the configuration needs, weight difference, and varying sizes, the selection and assembly process to construct these pallets is time-consuming and inefficient. To additionally complicate matters, much of the cargo to be transported typically is composed of non-standard packages which are individually picked and assembled onto pallets. There is a need for an Automated Pallet Planner (APP) tool that can automatically create a loading plan for how to load cargo onto pallets to be loaded onto an aircraft. Cybernet proposes to build an APP that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) concepts to analyze the cargo to be shipped and then creates a pallet loading plan. The loading of different items onto a single pallet is an example of the Multiple Bin Size Packing Problem (MBSPP) and the Multiple Heterogeneous Knapsack Problem (MHKP) for which there are a number of known solutions, despite the problem spaces being NP-Hard problems."

The effort will generate synthetic data for sensor algorithms that use machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for automatic target recognition (ATR) and SAR\/ISAR imaging of maritime targets.This proposed effort will lead to a high order accurate, physics-based, full wave modeling and simulation capability for NAVAIR in understanding the various discriminating electromagnetic scattering features (direct and multi-bounce, creeping and traveling waves, and wave interaction\/penetration with sea water) that can support the detection of periscopes in the presence of sea clutter. The end goal of this Phase II effort is to provide NAVAIR with a high-fidelity, physics-based simulation capability for use in the design of radar algorithms for use in high grazing angle maritime target (especially periscope \/ mast) detection and discrimination."

        "Abstract": "It has been observed that cyber-attacks are increasing in both prevalence and sophistication. Most existing cyber defense systems are still using the aged signature-matching techniques which can be easily avoided by current malware through polymorphic methods, such as obfuscation. In this effort, IAI proposes to develop DeepDefense, a deep-learning based cyber defense system to effectively detect and mitigate zero-day attacks. DeepDefense detects zero-day cyber-attacks by analyzing the software program behaviors which cannot be evaded by any polymorphic methods. DeepDefense utilizes a deep-learning based artificial intelligence method to automatically identify benign and malicious behaviors. DeepDefense will be implemented and run at the host end. Thus DeepDefense is network agnostic, and can provide uninterrupted security protection even under an encrypted network environment. The intrusion detection results from DeepDefense can be easily reported to an existing SIEM system to improve the security capabilities of mitigating zero-day attacks. Together, DeepDefense will provide advanced intrusion detection\/mitigation capabilities to enterprise networks, and provide continuous and uninterrupted security protection against zero-day attacks."

Humans tend to explain concepts with symbolic narratives, which contrasts the way non-symbolic machine learning represents concepts. This research addresses this challenge by grounding the research in the problem of helping transitioning veterans find relevant careers. The developed prototype will provide job recommendations emerging from a Long Short-Term Memory trained on word embeddings derived from 1.73 million job descriptions and 70,000 resumes. Explanations of matches are grounded in selected text segments, or StoryGraph elements, from an individuals resume with a skill decomposition graph providing additional clarification. By grounding the explanation, veterans will be able to understand causal relationships between resumes and job descriptions. The proposed second phase will investigate conceptual explanation through hierarchical learning and the potential for attention-based neural networks to improve the matching and semantic explanations. We will also extend the StoryGraph to provide insights into career path trajectories and create an interactive interface for veterans to gain deeper insights and explore hypotheticals. We propose an option task to explore generalizability by extending it to the medical domain to help match doctors and patients."

        "Abstract": "In complex tactical scenarios, mission planners are often confronted with mission goals and operational environment restrictions that limit their options. High cognitive workloads produced by manual assessments and operational concerns increase tactical decision timeframes. To address these problems and support mission planning and operations within National and Foreign Airspaces, Space, Maritime, and Land domains, mission planners need automated planning assistance which can quickly animate (visualize) the routes and mission plans and the tactical risks to personnel and property. To maintain the tactical initiative, Mission planners and Battle Management Aids must optimize mission performance in faster than real-time under dynamic, multi-variable conditions allowing Mission Commanders to initiate tactical actions on their terms. LG-RAID addresses these shortcomings. Using LG-Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a multi-domain mission planner, LG-RAID constructs an optimal 4D, geo-rectified, animated overlay that provides entity visualization and predictive Course of Action analysis capability for dynamic, multi-variable conditions within seconds on a standard desktop computer."

OMIPA will revolutionize the mission and strike planning process through the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Technically, OMIPA will feature adaptations of cutting edge AI techniques, including case based analysis, semi-supervised learning, adversarial RL training of neural networks, Monte Carlo tree search, and evolutionary computation. These techniques will help human planners create better, highly robust plans more quickly and reliably for a range of missions; they have been chosen to avoid the technical challenges described above. Powerful ML and AI algorithms will drive OMIPAs ability to generate actionable insights in the mission planning process, but it is our staged approach to the development and implementation of OMIPA that will be the key to system success,"

First, we will determine which functions in the current Joint Mission Planning System Maritime (JMPS-M) can be productively performed in a near-autonomous manner using (a) current JMPS-M methods, (b) methods from other Navy tactical decision aids, (c) deep learning, or (d) natural language processing. Next, we will develop a data collection framework to support near-autonomous mission planning and training of artificial algorithms which are components of it. Third, we will develop methods to create and dynamically update threat maps which allow us to exploit the proven capabilities of convolutional deep neural networks to analyze images for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). Option tasks will refine our overall plan and demonstrate the role natural language processing plays in mission planning."

        "Abstract": "GBL proposes the Rapid Artificially Intelligent Strike Mission Planner (RASP) to develop a layered technology approach that allows for the application of Machine Learning to this complex mission\/strike planning domain. The integration of RASP with JMPS will provide a foundation for implementing Artificially Intelligent Mission Planning techniques that learn from prior mission experience\/data. GBL proposes to utilize its NO4-174 EA-18G Electronic Combat Automation SBIR technologies called Electronic Combat Decision Support System as a core technology that will be leveraged. RASP will provide a Distributed Intelligent Agent-based framework (DAI) to automate development of platform mission plans. The Agent-based framework implements a publish and subscribe message system to allow for collaborative and concurrent planning amongst multiple mission planning teams across security levels while minimizing the face-to-face communication that slows the mission planning process. The decentralized capability of RASP will reduce mission planning time by allowing multiple users to simultaneously plan their role in a mission vice the waterfall method of planning that is often practiced today. The intelligent agents will communicate planning information amongst necessary users to help improve the mission planning workflow and ultimately reduce the overall time and improve automation of mission planning for multi-vehicle strike mission platforms."

The designed solution will leverage the work already conducted by NAVAIRs Training Analysis Project (TAP) regarding F\/A-18 air warfare. In doing so, the software will adhere to training best practices and align with the performance metrics that TAP has already identified as being critical to mission success in Component Commander plans. Since TAPs processes were designed to be scalable, this software will provide a methodology for the NAE to duplicate the entire TAP process for other platforms and mission sets in a manner that is streamlined and efficient. Artificial intelligence will be applied to enable automated and semi-automated methods for collection of data, assessment of performance, and reporting of training deficiencies. This improves the speed and effectiveness of the feedback to the trainee and the NAE leadership. The software will be designed to reside on hardware that is already resident at Fleet training locations (to reduce the physical footprint) and will incorporate an intuitive user interface (to minimize the need for additional aircrew training)."

In both of these applications it is valuable to have access to highly skilled automated actors. In a decision support context, this facilitates fast, high fidelity simulations with a variety of possible battlefield conditions. In a training context, this supports interactive learning tools and allows commanders to hone their skills through competition with difficult opponents.Historically, Artificial Intelligence agents that can match or beat expert human performance have been limited to turn-based games. However, due to the success of IBMs Deep Blue system at Chess, and more recently, DeepMinds AlphaGo system at Go, the latest research has begun to investigate if the techniques employed by these systems can be improved to achieve expert-level performance at less well-defined, real-time games.To manage the fundamental complexities that military-domain AI systems face, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation proposes the Framework for Intelligent Simulation Command with Hierarchically Embedded Reinforcement Learning (FISCHER). FISCHER will leverage the latest developments in Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning to provide a wargaming artificial intelligence that can perform at a humanlike level."

In particular, the following capabilities will help them dealing with the challenging real-world problems of off-road navigation: 1) Accurate terrain traversability assessment; 2) Optimal trajectory computation; and 3) Effective maneuver selection. Understanding how to implement these intelligent capabilities is the key to elevate a robot to become a trustworthy partner to human warfighters and can strengthen manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T). In this STTR effort, we have been developing ORION, a computational framework that implements such intelligent capabilitiestreating traversability assessment as a classification problem, optimal trajectory computation as a heuristic motion planning problem, and maneuver selection as a policy mapping problem. In this effort, those problems are being addressed by employing state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques such as the convolutional neural networks and sampling-based kinodynamic planning. In Phase I, by prototyping and field-testing the key\/high-risk capabilities using an operational robot, the development risks in Phase II were successfully mitigated. The overall goal of ORION Phase II is to develop the second generation of the ORION prototypes (ORION-2) that can demonstrate its full capabilities in relevant environment."

        "Abstract": "The proposed project aims to pursue an innovative approach of utilizing deep learning algorithms to improve the performance of state-of-the-art MEMS Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to push their performance to fullest extent possible as replacements for existing Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (FOG) systems for navigation and guidance in future missile system avionics including Sounding Rockets. During Phase I, the proposed team will evaluate artificial intelligence algorithms to model noisy MEMS sensor data. A deep learning methodology will be employed to effectively define complex, compositional nonlinear functions, to learn distributed and hierarchical feature representations, and to make effective inference of both labeled and unlabeled data. We plan on implementing machine learning algorithm on a FPGA platform after identifying the most promising software algorithms. The Phase I program is ambitious by design but we believe that research plans are realistic and achievable because of our expertise and resources accumulated from on-going research in the areas of inertial sensor design, machine learning, and microelectronics. The prototype hardware is useful for ground testing and to demonstrate that the proposed solution can meet flight environments. At the end of Phase II, a prototype will be ready to be flown on a sounding rocket flight test.Approved for Public Release | 17-MDA-9395(24 Oct 17)"

The only solution to combat this situation is to incentivize cybersecurity defenders to train more frequently with a purpose to continuously learn new skills regardless of their current skill level and to increase the speed of their Cyber Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop to make it faster than the attacker. The EpiSci and Viasat team propose the Tactical Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity Training System (TACTS) as a powerful tool for training new and experienced users. TACTS consists of a game built on top of the CORE\/EMANE network simulator, with a highly customized set of interactive user interfaces, an intuitive scoring mechanism built on a large collection of Threat Intelligence, a cybersecurity red team agent based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for intelligent execution of cyber-attacks without a human-in-the-loop, and a cybersecurity red team agent based on Surprise-Based Learning (SBL) that learns to predict a users behavior and forces them into previously unencountered situations.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

For the study, three development teams will be chosen, and given an identical set of projects to develop. Team members and their code will ranked through an AI (artificial intelligence) program module that will assemble and evaluate their code product. The AI-based program will quantitatively evaluate each programmers skills and efficiency, and render a report card of sorts, ranking them on an intuitive number of metrics.The proposed system will cohesively combine our own procedures and processes with open-source platforms. The system will employ metrics from several sources, including academic papers, studies and tests of our design. As its end-product, the evaluation system will generate an unbiased performance rating that will auto-vet and rank each programmer or developer to be considered for a given project."

        "Abstract": "Applying machine learning based multi-sensor analytics to detect, identify, and associate threats to forward deployed installations requires a multidisciplinary approach. In addition, uniquely combining machine learning with multi-INT sensing significantly increases the capability to detect and understand threats from physical intrusion. However, traditional security and surveillance solutions typically process and analyze sensor outputs independently without intelligently combining information between multiple sensor types - leaving the capabilities of these systems limited or predictable. Therefore, we propose an effort to research and develop improved multi-sensor analytics methods based on machine learning, specifically for forward operating bases in areas with adjacent or nearby urban environments. More specifically, we propose combining a DLRT for object (e.g., video, person, etc.) detection and tracking with the RNN-LSTM method described in the last section for combined video, signal and acoustic detection, tracking, and notification (i.e., automatic sentences or tag sequences) of threats (both objects and behavior). We will establish the relevance of the proposed machine learning approaches based on our previous experience and ongoing efforts with similar applications. In addition, we will identify relevant data sources, both new and from our existing catalog of projects, that support threat detection and prediction."

        "Abstract": "Friendly forces at forward operating bases and expeditionary airfields require autonomous solutions to alerts of potential threats (dismounts, drones, etc.). For such a system to be useful, it needs to operate at high probability of detection and low probability of false alarm. Several technical challenges exist, including the variability of environments and threat types, the presence of background activity, and the need for an easy set-up process. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a Layered Omnidirectional Threat Tracking and Alert system (LOTTA). LOTTA uses a scalable, heterogeneous suite of complimentary sensors (EO\/IR, GMTI and UGS) to detect threats of varying type (humans, vehicles, quad-copters, etc.) and behaviors (moving and stationary). Next, LOTTA uses STRs Multi-Stage Multiple-Hypothesis Tracker (MS-MHT) to fuse detections from complementary sensors and track these potential threats. LOTTA uses state-of-the art machine learning techniques to classify target types, and detect attributes and behaviors that could indicate a threat (e.g., a human carrying a weapon, or a vehicle driving a certain way toward the asset). Finally, LOTTA provides a user interface for easy sensor configuration, threat definition (e.g., drawing of a tripwire) and threat alert."

The objective of RAISIN is to improve communications in a tactical network with situational awareness and provide the commander with actionable intelligence that is represented by the value of information (VoI). The tactical network consists of artificial and human agents each equipped with embedded sensors and operating with different communication links subject to computational (processing power), bandwidth and other (such as energy) constraints. Each agent generates metadata obtained with deep learning methods describing the recorded content and decides what metadata to transmit depending on its resources. RAISIN uses deep learning to characterize the VoI for the generated metadata and assist commander to produce queries according to the mission. RAISIN also applies deep learning based information retrieval methodology to find low-cost models according to agents processing power and battery lifetime to generate metadata and handle potential errors in metadata processing. The goal is to deliver the best VoI such that the commander can make the decisions faster and with higher fidelity."

Our solution will take results from machine learning and artificial intelligence and combine those with a software defined networking (SDN) concept designed for challenged tactical networks. In particular, Markov decision process (MDP) and Q-learning will be used in a reinforced learning (RL) approach to define data routing policies and media access policies in light of network conditions as input (congestion, jamming, channel fading, data delay, data bandwidth\/throughput, packet loss, node mobility, node battery power level etc.). Our SDN design contains functions and optimized data storage to enable network nodes to operate in intermittently connected network conditions, which can be considered normal operating conditions in a tactical edge network."

Analysts will interact with intuitive interfaces in a visual environment built around their workflows. AIRE will leverage AI\/ML techniques to find trends and connect the dots among data, and then allow more explainable statistical methods to be run on data to provide more explainability to the analyst than using black box methods alone. These methods will be combined with the use of deep linguistic features, such as semantic information and other relevant metadata, to fuse authorship detection and intent recognition methods, rather than treating them as separate routines. This combination of analytical techniques in an intuitive interface will make AIRE a significant innovation and a valuable tool to several end users."

Infrared imagery can improve visibility in degraded visual environments, however when heavily degraded, this method alone is insufficient. Obscurants and noise can be rapidly categorized and suppressed in real-time by having an artificial intelligence trained to select and apply the most suitable modern image processing technique for a given frame. Phase I efforts have completed a proof-of-concept and successful prototype. Phase II efforts will deploy this to a testbed system for testing. Additional data from new environments will be acquired and analyzed. New image restoration methods will be added and the AI revised to utilize them. Dual-use algorithms will be explored to enhance driver performance. Hardware acceleration and embedded system design will also be studied to improve the testbed further.Phase III efforts will focus on widespread implementation."

        "Abstract": "With the advent of additive manufacturing (AM), lattice structures are being deployed today in a variety of engineering applications where light-weight, large surface area, energy absorption, etc., are critical. However, the design and fabrication of such lattice structures poses several challenges. From a design perspective, current methods are computationally prohibitive, or require artificial constraints that significantly reduce the design space. Furthermore, it has been observed that the resulting lattice structures are sub-optimal when compared to non-lattice-structure designs obtained through classic macro-scale optimization. From a manufacturing perspective, incorporating process constraints and accounting for lower-than-nominal structural performances into the design process has also been elusive.TDAs proposed work addresses the SBIR topic objectives of developing an intelligent framework to design and analyze scalable lattice architectures for missile applications. Based on our teams expertise in topology optimization, modeling for AM process and nondestructive testing, our approach consists of: (1) extend in-house conforming lattice structure optimization to include stress constraints under static and dynamic loading, (2) address process-related challenges of manufacturing, (3) use predictive modeling of lattice structure behavior under all loading to determine a statistical basis of failure propagation and risk-based decision and (4) perform experimental testing and validation using Digital Image Correlation."

NAVSEA IWS has sponsored the creation of the DECIDE Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool to augment the ability of observers of training and certification exercises to more rapidly, accurately, and efficiently assess individual and team performance in mission critical tasks. DECIDE will adaptively direct evaluator attention to performance issues of greatest importance in confirming qualification with respect to standards, will embed those standards into real time performance criteria satisfaction decision making, and will maintain a running aggregate competency\/qualification appraisal for support of interim or post exercise feedback on demand. All of this capability is packaged for use in the tactical environmentshore based or in combat spaces aboard ship, while at rest or underway. In this proposal, we offer continuing development of the most important enhancements that advance DECIDE to the state of maturity where it will be ready for test and evaluation in the operational environment by its intended users. We also propose collaboration with the 3rd Fleet ATG that has been suggested as the test organization to prepare the tool for their evaluation, train the users, and assist as needed.TBD"

WhizRT will be able to intelligently choose its actions through an attack behavior tree and execute attack steps across the hands-on playing field. It combines state-of-the-art machine learning with attack tree models and automated attack execution. The playing field is an actual networked IT environment hosted within a virtual machine environment. Using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (esp. artificial neural networks), the attacker can adapt its choices of attack steps over time by learning from the defenders behaviors, successes\/failures etc.The project revolves around two broad areas, the WhizRT intelligent red team system (based on AI, attack behavior trees, and attack step execution), and the training game concept and testbed (based on interconnected VMs with lifecycle management, scoring, education etc.). WhizRT will be developed to be flexible, and in particular to be deployable in other cybersecurity training game platforms. We are highly qualified and positioned to make the proposed effort a success, and have proven to provide exceptional quality and value (incl. several SBIRs).Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9710 (6 Jul 18)"

        "Abstract": "Information flow is central to effective command and control. As technologies continue to evolve in communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, there is a growing wealth of information available to the commander. This abundance of information can be underutilized given the operational tempo. What is needed are command tools with capabilities that assist commanders with timely synthesis of information relevant to the decisions at hand, while minimizing the burden of distraction from excess information. We propose to build the Command and Control Assistant for Marine Commanders (C2-ASSIST), leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques currently used in digital assistants to assist commanders with battlespace decision making.The C2-ASSIST system will integrate with existing command tools and perform filtering, searching, and synthesis on large amounts of data. C2-ASSIST will find information relevant to current tasks and questions, predict impacts of the existing data on future plans, and automate complex tasks.During Phase I we will identify the requirements of the system to be built; define how C2-ASSIST will integrate with existing user interfaces and data sources; select the existing algorithms, tools, and libraries that will complete the required tasks and requests; develop and evaluate a prototype; and develop the Phase II system design."

Our research and development will identify the areas that need to be addressed, propose and study alternative solutions, and provide simulated but relevant input to test our hypotheses against known CAC2S use cases. Our proposed technical solution is a modified version of Googles SyntaxNet and TensorFlow; an open-source AI framework that implements a feedforward neural network with a greedy transition-based parser. The open-source nature of those frameworks allows us to ultimately build an embedded AI system that can be installed on a classified CAC2S network without a connection to the Internet."

However, significant modeling choices must still be made in trying to achieve answers accurate enough for engineering decisions, but without unwarranted computational effort. This is especially true for high value complex submarine hull structures that are needed to protect Navy warfighters and enable successful missions. Using a rational series of models of varying fidelity, M4 Engineering will develop a comprehensive design guide of best practices and their temporal and spatial regions of applicability that can be utilized by the Navy and its contractors during their design and analysis activities. A comprehensive manual set giving specifications that will standardize submarine hull structure modeling best practices will be created. Artificial intelligence methods will be used to create a complementary software tool to provide an automated means for giving detailed modeling recommendations for specific designs. The design recommendations and the process for developing them will be validated via a companion experimental program that will be planned partially during Phase I for execution during later project phases."

        "Abstract": "Planning for anti-submarine missions requires the TASW Battle Watch Captain to understand the intentions of the enemy based on a vast context of information. There are many factors that these watch standers use to draw their conclusions. Everything from weather to recent hostilities can affect their decision making. An opportunity exists to create an automatic tool for assessing theater-wide ASW situations by leveraging state of the art expert systems technology to assist the TASW Battle Watch Captain. Discovery Machine, Inc. (DMI) in partnership with Arorae Corporation (together the DMI team) proposes to leverage the DM Knowledge Service Modeler (KSM) to create a TASW console. The DM Knowledge Service Modeler is an open and extensible architecture based on artificial intelligence and knowledge capture software. Our research has resulted in technology that enables subject matter experts (SMEs) to capture and deploy their own expertise into decision support systems resulting in better automation and increased performance of personnel. DMI&apos;s technology does not require the experts to write code. It builds on how SMEs currently assess a situation, and applies expertise to automate and assist."

These tools will vastly improve Aegis operational readiness and save at least $7M per year in program costs. Two new tools will be developed. An AI-based tool called TurboTOR will meet critical needs identified during Phase I for improving change request specificity and reducing duplicate Trouble Observation Reports (TORs). In effect, it provides a virtual software developer to the tester to help tease out intricacies of an observed defect. The AI-based Replicate Prioritization Decisions (RAPID) tool maps Computer Program Change Requests (CPCRs) to specifications, determines baseline applicability, and estimates change request adjudication parameters. The tools will be integrated within the Aegis Combat Systems Engineering Agents (CSEAs; Lockheed Martin) and the Navys operational environments. Lockheed Martin is a significant teaming partner and will provide over a thousand hours of guidance from seven element leads (ADS, CND, WCS, etc), ClearQuest, DOORS and ACCESS integrators, and CSEDS testers. This intensive integration provides a springboard for Phase II Navy integration and evaluation at IWSL, SCSC, and other facilities. CSEDS and Navy feedback throughout Phase II will be used to continually improve the tools."

        "Abstract": "For operational robots to be truly effective in the battlefield, they would need to be integrated with intelligent decision-making capabilities. In particular, the following capabilities would help them to deal with the challenging real-world problems of off-road navigation, namely, traversability assessment (Capability 1), optimal trajectory computation (Capability 2), and optimal maneuver selection (Capability 3). In this STTR effort, we propose to develop ORION, a computational framework that provides an operational robot with intelligent capabilities to effectively deal with real-world problems of off-road navigation. ORION treats Capability 1 as a classification problem, and addresses it by employing state-of-art deep learning techniques. It treats Capability 2 as a heuristic motion planning problem, and solves it by applying state-of-art classical artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of sampling-based kinodynamic planning. Finally, it treats Capability 3 as a policy mapping problem, and solves it by utilizing standard reinforcement learning."

        "Abstract": "Durga addresses the Air Forces need for Autonomous Satellite Ground Operations using a mature suite of software methods that detect and respond to anomalies in streams of data, both in real time and over history. In addition to detecting rapid spikes or gradual drifts in telemetry data, Durgas methods can discover periodic and seasonal patterns, as well as connections between data features that can assist operators in diagnosing and handling complex non-deterministic scenarios. These analytics, collectively called the Cognitive Engine, are powered by new advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and they form the core of a complete system architecture that also defines methods for data acquisition and storage according to a uniform data model, and standards for data visualization and user interaction. The architecture enables the system to scale in data volume and velocity from an initial prototype in a single Space Operations Center to a global system-of-systems deployment, and it provides a pathway for incremental growth in complexity by adding new features into the data space and by adding new algorithms to the Cognitive Engine. The full Durga architecture also contains a powerful condition-action Rules Engine that enables expert users to create deterministic responses to specific events."

        "Abstract": "The architectural complexity of a software code base has a significant impact on its reliability and maintainability. In general, as the complexity increases, so do the number of bugs, the amount of time required to fix each bug, and the amount of time required to adjust existing features or add new features to the software. We propose to build the Case-Based Reasoning System for Software Architecture Evaluation and Insight (CBR-Insight), to provide contracting officials with a tool they can use to measure and understand the ramifications of architectural complexity and technical debt.  CBR-Insight combines the functionality of a leading COTS static analysis tool with case-based reasoning techniques from artificial intelligence. The result is a web-application capable of calculating the propagation cost, core size, and other key metrics and fully leveraging these results to provide insight into software product quality. In Phase I, we developed and tested a primary component of the Phase II system that calculates these metrics and creates an interactive report of the results.   During Phase II, we will build on this prior work to develop the complete CBR-Insight system, towards the goal of creating software to assist the U.S. Air Force in improving software quality."

We will develop a plug-play architecture that will allow us to make the best use of emerging technologies, and innovate in three ways. First, the proposed system will automatically translate aggregate evidence into a decision support environment composed of actionable visualizations and infographics. Second, we will employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate information retrieval, data extraction, and knowledge modelingthereby allowing scientists to focus their attention on the aspects of the process where their expertise is indispensable. Third, we will design the proposed system from the start to be adaptive. End users will be able to target new information sources, change research vocabulary, and focus on new research patterns or metrics. Phase I research and development will result in a limited proof-of-concept demonstration as well as a roadmap for a complete prototype implementation and evaluation in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "To address the Navy need for a real-time capability for anomaly-based detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in Internet Protocol based Combat System networks, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Statistical Intrusion Detection System Generating Policy-based Responses to Cyber Threats (STINGER) based on Markov decision processes and intelligent action policy. This combination provides artificial intelligence needed to detect and mitigate the APTs and both known and new cyber-attacks. STINGER monitors network traffic, dynamically detects and classifies attacks using statistical analysis and an anomaly-based intrusion detection mechanism. STINGERs infrastructure-agnostic intrusion detection\/response mechanism enables detection of currently undetectable new generation of cyber-attacks, such as highly distributed and coordinated attacks and low frequency attacks, as well as classification and mitigation of attacks. In Phase I, POC will develop STINGERs overall system architecture, framework and algorithms, and demonstrate feasibility by assembling and testing a prototype. In the Phase I Option we will refine the system design and prepare detailed technical specifications for the software to be developed in Phase II. In Phase II, POC will develop an advanced prototype to demonstrate real-time attack pattern detection and attack classification prediction model capabilities in representative enterprise networks and environments."

The current state-of-the-art will be researched to find methods that can be used to improve vehicle maneuverability in difficult terrain. Two other methods will be compared. These methods are nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and a machine learning method associated with trajectory generation. This work will compare these methods in simulation and then implement and test the best method on a fully automated Ford Escape."

        "Abstract": "Analysts within the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) community have a challenging role, one that requires the ability to navigate and interpret mounds of data to produce responsive products during Phase 1 processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED). New tools and information displays continue to increase the complexity of the analysts workspace without established human-machine interface or interaction guidelines for sustained usability and naturalistic system interaction. An innovative and engaging human-machine interface\/interaction (HMI) framework that takes advantage of emerging ubiquitous interaction technologies and paradigms is needed. To address this challenge, the Aptima team developed the Adaptive Personalized Environment for Artificial Intelligence and Naturalistic Applications for PED Operational Domain (A PEA IN A POD). The objective of A PEA IN A POD is to design and develop advanced multimodal human-machine interfaces and interactions for full-motion video (FMV) data analysis PED to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of product creation, information management, and interaction between analysts. The analysts user interface provided by A PEA IN A POD is driven by integrated context-based reasoning to enable proactive support of the analysts and form connections of information across data sources."

As a result, pilots must actively and manually process the data to identify and process targets. This takes the pilots focus and attention away from more important and critical tasks. There is however potential for a system to passively and intelligently monitor and analyze IR data and notify the pilot when a threat is detected that requires the pilot to handle and respond to the situation. In this proposal, we describe a solution that incorporates a variety of image-enhancing algorithms and state- of-the-art computer vision techniques as well as advanced artificial intelligence reasoning frameworks to create a high performing system that also has low false-positive rates. For each detected object, the system will extract a variety of defining characteristics and features, such as size, shape, location, and heat signature as well as longer-term flight patterns. The system will also be designed to be easily integrated into existing onboard systems."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: The architectural complexity of a software code base has a significant impact on its operability, maintainability, and extensibility. In general, as the complexity increases, so do the number of bugs, the amount of time required to fix each bug, and the amount of time required to adjust existing features or add new features to the software. We propose to build the Case Based Reasoning System for Software Architecture Evaluation and Insight (CBR Insight), to provide contracting officials with a tool they can use to measure and understand the ramifications of architectural complexity.CBR Insight will combine the functionality of a leading COTS static analysis tool with case based reasoning techniques from artificial intelligence and leverage existing visualization and automation software. The result is a tool capable of generating the propagation cost and core size metrics and fully leveraging these results to provide insight into operational performance, risks, and costs.During Phase I we will develop use cases and requirements, design the CBR Insight system, build a limited prototype, evaluate the prototype on open-source DOD projects, gather feedback, and develop a plan for Phase II.; BENEFIT: The most direct targets for marketing the results of this effort are contracting officials and others involved in government and commercial software acquisition. CBR Insight would be especially attractive to this market given that it is an analysis tool designed for non-developers. By demonstrating significant results in evaluating and understanding the ramifications of software architectural complexity in Phase II, CBR Insight will provide the US Air Force with a strong incentive to fund the Phase III deployment of the proposed system.A secondary target of this effort is to market CBR Insight as an extension to the existing COTS code analysis tool that CBR Insight will be integrated with. CBR Insight would provide powerful new capabilities that would be of interest to current and new software developers utilizing their system. Additionally, any development team being evaluated on these architectural complexity metrics would need to put tools in place to monitor metric scores throughout the development process."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: There is a need to develop a sufficient-fidelity simulation tool to create multi-sensor datasets for human activity detection and recognition. To address this need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) and Infoscitex Corporation (IST) propose a novel, integrated, sufficient-fidelity simulation tool called HumanView (HumV). The proposed software will leverage existing tools, integrate commercial, proprietary and COTS multi-physics simulation tools and material properties databases. The key elements of the proposed architecture are: The HumV Models module will be a data store that will contain 3D human models, 3D geometric models of environment, relevant sensor models (RF, LIDAR and Hyperspectral) and platform models (UAV, aircraft) on which the sensors reside. The HumV editor module will allow researchers to discover the available models, manage the configuration associated with a model using a drag-n-drop interface, and create specific activities for the model, and associate mathematical models where appropriate. The HumV simulator module will allow the user to simulate multiple scenarios that will generate the synthetic sensor data for analytics. The goal of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of HumV.Specific focus areas will include developing the overall architecture, and developing key HumV components.; BENEFIT: Development of HumV will allow the military to generate realistic and physically sound sensor imagery data from virtual 3D scenes, expanding capabilities of ISR applications. The technology would also be useful in other arenas such as analytical technology development for homeland security applications. HumV would be beneficial to developers of first responder support equipment for operations such as search and rescue.Commercial application of HumV include the fast growing field of robotics. Just as LIDAR simulators are used by roboticists today to test their algorithms, HumV may be used by developers of self-driving cars (which use a variety of sensors) and any other Artificial Intelligence or robotic systems that interact with humans, enabling the development of algorithms for navigating in human environments."

To realize this goal will require development of graphical BTNs to represent the reasoning processes appropriate to different applications (satellite and\/or UAV ISR tipping\/cueing, satellite bus telemetry data analysis, etc.) and situations along with user-editing features, CBR structure within which to embed the BTNs, and intelligent scheduling capability to optimize the ISR tasking.  The next logical step, as addressed by this proposal, is to develop the full-scale PROACT and integrate it with required existing systems (e.g., EGS, GeoDBs, etc.) for the different applications. We will investigate the ISR tipping\/cueing and satellite data bus telemetry problems in more depth.  These investigations will require access to classified information to make sure the full complexity of the problems and all of the required and desired constraints and capabilities are handled.  Fortunately, Stottler Henke has a TOP SECRET facility clearance."

        "Abstract": "U.S. forces are benefiting from automation systems of unprecedented sophistication, empowered by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-systems interaction. In air combat operations, onboard intelligent assistants monitor the aircraft, interpret and carry out commands, and report aircraft and system status, mission progress, threats and alerts. Because pilots and agents are part of a network that may involve ambiguous communications and dynamic roles and responsibilities, Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2AD) raises significant implications for how aircrew can work with their intelligent associates. There is thus a need for training, concepts of operations (CONOPS), and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to combat this threat. A2AD effects can have devastating effects on how people and intelligent systems work together. An urgent need has surfaced for a robust capability to simulate, test, predict, and evaluate how these human\/agent teams can succeed when faced by both nominal and adverse conditions. In Phase I, we demonstrated a framework that overcomes limitations of current modeling approaches, which are not adequate to properly capture work practices of the socio-technical system. In Phase II, we propose creating a contested airspace simulation testbed that addresses this urgent need using an innovative application of a sophisticated and proven work practice analysis simulation."

        "Abstract": "Predictive medicine has considerable potential to improve clinical outcomes during the crucial minutes and hours immediately following combat trauma. There is a requirement for an avatar solution that serves a multitude of functions for predictive medicine in the battlefield and beyond, including digital health data warehousing and prediction of immediate and long-term outcomes associated with various combinations of injuries, clinical treatments, and baseline genetic and physiology profiles. The proposed solution will address this requirement by providing a mixed reality, holographic manifestation of a physiologically accurate warrior health profile. The avatar solution will be customizable for individual soldiers, representing past, present, and predicted future medical history, and automatically updatable with mobile health sensor and EHR integration. The proposed effort will focus on the development of a modeling and simulation framework for prediction of immediate and long-term persontreatment interactions following life threatening battlefield traumatic injuries, integrating the digital warrior assets with drag-and-drop user interface functionality. Additionally, this effort will develop the underlying unsupervised statistical learning capabilities within an established, open-source, and scalable artificial intelligence architecture. Product commercialization will emphasize custom, virtual training scenario development based on medically accurate events, with the ultimate objective of an avatar model shadowing every military combat personnel."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: The useful life of medium caliber gun barrels is dominated by fatigue cracking initiated early in the weapons deployment. Fatigue cracks worsen in severity throughout the life of the barrel until they reach a critical size, indicating end of life. During the Phase I effort, Luna demonstrated that eddy current (EC) techniques are effective in detecting both machined and fatigue-induced cracks inside gun barrels. EC-based measurements performed on several medium caliber barrels were not influenced by the intricate rifling profile of the bore of the barrel while remaining sensitive to cracks ranging from under 0.02 inches to greater than 0.375 inches. In the Phase II effort, Luna proposes development of an EC-based prototype with artificial intelligence post-processing algorithms for complete autonomy in assessing fatigue condition within barrels. A man-portable prototype for use on flight lines will be assembled, allowing for barrel evaluation without requiring their removal from the aircraft. Based on a multi-frequency excitation scheme, an improved design of the probes, and a trained neural classifier, the prototype will identify the number of existing cracks around the barrel circumference and assess their individual depths and locations.; BENEFIT: This project directly addresses the need for increasing savings and reducing maintenance cost of medium caliber gun barrels. Maintenance time and costs will be reduced by increasing barrel usage and reducing barrel replacement frequency. Currently, medium caliber gun barrels are retired when a maximum number of rounds is reached, often leading to premature removals. The developed system will allow for continued barrel usage throughout its entire useful life. The overall anticipated result of this effort is development of a new tool for assessing the condition of medium caliber gun inventory, replacing todays statistically-based gun retirement protocol with a condition-based inventory management protocol. The proposed technology has broad market potential and meets a significant economic and national security need. Anticipated commercial uses include pipe inspection in the electric power, marine propulsion, and petrochemical industries."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: While the ability to collect larger volumes of full-motion video (FMV) data grows, analysts within the ISR community struggle to keep pace with the volume, speed, and variety of collection. During Phase 1 Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED), analysts are required to collaborate with a distributed team of sensor operators, collection and mission managers, and other analysts while navigating and interpreting mounds of data across many disparate sources to produce actionable decisions. Given the pace of these data-intensive workflows, analysts frequently encounter a problem of information management, ranging from the coordination challenges associated with maintaining situational awareness and contextual knowledge while exploiting data across sensor types to identify potential targets, to retrieving, processing, and utilizing sensor data in a timely manner once collected. To address this need, Aptima proposes to develop the Adaptive Personalized Environment for Artificial Intelligence and Naturalistic Applications for PED Operational Domain (A PEA IN A POD). When fully implemented, A PEA IN A PODs advanced multimodal human-machine interfaces and interactions for Phase 1 PED of FMV data will improve information management and interaction between FMV analysts and the technologies they use, therefore creating efficiencies while reducing manpower requirements to support a wide range of ISR missions.; BENEFIT: A PEA IN A POD utilizes emerging technologies, such as immersive visualization, multimodal user interfaces, gesture tracking, speech recognition, and multi-touch, to help FMV analysts accomplish data-intensive PED tasks more quickly and effectively. Benefits include:Combining human analytical reasoning and the human visual system with the latest computational tools for analyzing, displaying, and interaction with information;The ability for users to contextualize and interpret sensor and information feeds in real-time via a more naturalistic, embodied experience;Increased analytic capacity and decreased cognitive load by using strategies for managing multimodal interactions in support of the analysts specific tasking;Increased situation awareness and reduced overall workload via context-driven user interfaces and interactions designed for ISR analysis tasks;Commercialization potential within the defense, homeland security, intelligence community, and healthcare markets."

        "Abstract": "SoarTech, along with our partners Adaptive Cognitive Systems and Aptima, are applying our vast expertise in the design, development and integration of artificial intelligence technologies, bringing it to bear to help develop more realistic entity-level scenarios for USMC simulated training. Most crucial to our work will be the design and development of a full infrastructure, called SERUM (Simulated training Exercises with Robust Unmanned Models) to support advanced AI for the USMCs simulation technology portfolio. This infrastructure will allow for robust, unmanned entities to exist in virtual simulation environments (e.g., VBS2), and will also include the necessary hooks and mechanisms to allow entities to both perceive the world and make actions within it.Using SERUM, developers and knowledge engineers can develop and integrate behaviors that drive SUDM characters within VBS2, thereby reducing the role player footprint required to support training. We anticipate that this resultant capability will provide significant flexibility for executing virtual and augmented-reality SUDM training by significantly reducing the constant requirement for manned role player support. Because the automated role players are driven by robust AI models and not scripts, training scenarios that use them can be much more dynamic and representative of the trainees operational responsibilities."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT:The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve OPIR follow-on ISR tipping and cueing; dramatically shorten the associated response time to new OPIR events; and improve ISR collection quality, resulting in: improved analyst performance; better-quality schedules; and higher, and better utilization of sensors. The goals of the Phase I research are to understand the OPIR tipping and cueing domain; elicit required planning knowledge related to follow-on sensor tasking from expert satellite image analysts; understand the resources, tasks, and constraints relating to the ISR scheduling problem; investigate integration requirements; define the appropriate performance metrics; elaborate the heuristics, algorithms, and techniques for improved OPIR tipping\/cueing as well as to analyze them as to their feasibility in several dimensions and against the metrics; develop the Phase II system design; and further prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development and demonstrations in realistic scenarios. Stottler Henke has developed significant technologies and techniques for both the planning and scheduling parts of the problem AND we have teamed with actual analysts from BOTH the defense and intelligence communities who have extensive experience with the tipping and cueing process.BENEFIT:The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, this countrys ISR satellite system itself. The work is also applicable to other ISR assets such as UAVs. By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational systems, we will provide the DoD and intelligence communities with a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed PROACT. Beyond these there are several commercialization possibilities available in the Government and private sector. The algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force, Navy, and MDA sensor customers interested in sensor management. As mentioned in this proposal, commercial companies now offer satellite sensor services and these are potential targets as well. There are other commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler. We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains. The additional capabilities developed for OPIR tipping and cueing can be synergistically marketed to the same clients. For example, the bottleneck avoidance algorithm proposed as fully developed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers. We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: Remarkable advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-systems integration are providing aircrew with cockpit automation systems of unprecedented sophistication. Onboard intelligent assistants monitor the aircraft, interpret and carry out pilot commands, and advise the pilot (onboard or remote) as to aircraft and system status, mission progress, threats and alerts. Because pilots and agents are part of a network that may involve ambiguous communications and dynamic roles and responsibilities, Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2AD) raises significant implications for how aircrew can work with their intelligent associates. There is thus a need for concepts of operations (CONOPS), training, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to combat the A2AD threat. Current approaches that employ models within simulations of an operating environment (OE) are not adequate to properly capture work practices of the socio-technical system. A2AD effects may disrupt discrete entities but can also have devastating effects on the way people and intelligent systems work together. An urgent need has surfaced for a more robust capability to simulate, test, predict, and evaluate how these human\/agent teams can succeed when faced by both nominal and adverse conditions. We propose addressing this urgent need with an innovative application of a sophisticated and proven work practice analysis simulation.; BENEFIT: Results from this work will establish an approach to agent-based modeling that provides a powerful, activity-based approach that represents how functions are carried out in practice, including interactions among aircrew and associate systems. This will pave the way for experimentation, testing and training to research how pilots, remote pilots and their automation systems collaborate in contested environments. Commercial applications include Air Force and DoD agencies and commands with oversight of training, experimentation and testing, where operating in contested environments is an established need. Across DoD, other services have related needs for continuous operations in A2AD conditions as well as specific requirements, such as submarine or littoral operations. The need for manned\/unmanned team training in counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, border protection, law enforcement and incident response presents commercial opportunities in other government sectors. Operations in the environment of space share exposure to risks much like those faced by the Air Force in conducting mixed human\/autonomous operations under A2AD conditions. The capability for testing, training and validating team operations in any degraded environments that create contested-like conditions will enable a robust array of commercial opportunities."

        "Research_Keywords": "Gun barrel inspectio",
        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Gun barrels have a variety of failure modes that must be monitored over the life of a barrel. Fatigue cracking is one of the most critical failure modes and can result in catastrophic barrel rupture if not detected and addressed. Currently, there is no existing NDI method or equipment to assess fatigue cracking within the barrel wall. Luna&quot;s proposed technique has the advantage of automated inspection using compact and portable hardware that can deployed on a flight line without need to remove barrels from the aircraft. Present eddy current inspection techniques rely on highly trained personnel to visually inspect and interpret test data, with human error serving as the primary drawback in using eddy currents to inspect the health of tubes. The automation of eddy current analysis and flaw sizing is very important in this research effort. Luna&quot;s proposed technique makes use of artificial intelligence to classify the eddy current signals and to recognize disruptive variables such as variation in microstructure (magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity), lift-off and edge effects, as well as the rifling signature itself.  The system will be designed to account for these variables and differentiate fatigue crack characteristics (fault length and depth) from false readings.  BENEFIT:  Luna&quot;s goal for this project is to develop a portable inspection device that is suitable to inspect gun barrels on a flight line without need to remove them from the aircraft. The proposed work plan is focused on detecting cracks that grow radially outward into the barrel wall, providing an assessment of fault location, length, and depth. This technique is important to the military community, but is applicable to many other industries as well. For example, pipelines, pressure vessels, and steam generator tubes for power plants all contain critical modes of cracking such as fatigue cracking, fretting corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, or intergranular attacking on the outer surfaces of tubes. As design and analysis techniques evolve to incorporate fatigue crack detection, it is important to have measurement techniques capable of providing supporting data. The proposed technology expands the assessment of fatigue cracking capability to support these important challenges."

Building on the Phase I success, we will develop low-level sensor signal processing code and high-level feature extraction software to determine physical and kinematic features of the sensed objects.  We will begin with the specifications for the primary sensors and descriptions of the primary targets of interest as well as the operational situations that are expected.   An important objective of this Phase II effort is to gather additional experiment data to determine operational accuracy and limitations, validate our approach, and supplement existing databases. Using the existing and collected data as a basis, we can perform knowledge elicitation with our UDRI sensor experts to determine what features can be reliably extracted from the sensor data and in what situations.  Based on what features are extractable, we can develop the automated reasoning to take advantage of them for both correlation and classification."

        "Abstract": "Rapid, reliable and secure information sharing is critical for achieving better awareness and access to actionable intelligence.  The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) is exposing ever greater volumes of information via the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) through web services.  Intelligence Community (IC) Directives mandate access to such intelligence information sharing is done securely with privacy guarantees. Although the data products and metadata contain appropriate CAPCO markings, the current deployed DIB systems lack identity and attribute awareness, which create artificially restrictive security boundaries. This prevents commanders and analysts from accessing critical data resulting in diminished net-centric capability and reduced availability of relevant intelligence data.    Modus Operandi proposes to develop REFRACT (REdaction FilteRing Access ConTrol), an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework. REFRACT delivers capabilities to create and maintain security policies for fine-grained access control of sensitive data stored in a DIB. REFRACT is powered by an innovative approach to creating, validating the enacting security policy requirements that are expressed in user-understandable syntax. REFRACT will deliver on the mission benefit that can be achieved by enabling true, fine-grained access to multi-level security data products, maximizing the intelligence data visible to the warfighter while avoiding leakage of prohibited data."

        "Abstract": "There may be no more important mission for the US military than protection from ballistic missile attack.  For any configuration of sensors, it is therefore extremely important to make the most of the collected sensor data.  Specifically, this proposal describes how this objective can be accomplished by using artificial intelligence techniques to implement human-quality reasoning on object features extracted from sensor data.  The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to better utilize disparate sensor data to perform better correlations and lethality assessments for ballistic missile defense targets in the midcourse phase through the development of a sensor data fusion system.  By performing human quality reasoning, the proposed system can perform superiorly to other systems utilizing the same sensor data.  The goals of the Phase I research are to understand the missile defense radar-IR sensor fusion domain, elaborate the heuristics, algorithms and techniques for multi-sensor data fusion correlation and classification, analyze them as to their feasibility in several dimensions, collect actual X-band and IR sensor data in Phase I, further prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development and performance testing with real data, and develop the Phase II system design."

        "Abstract": "The USMC has an immediate need for a framework and infrastructure with which state-of-the-art AI technologies can be integrated to replace simplistic CGF behaviors in virtual simulation platforms such as VBS2. SoarTech, along with our partner Aptima, proposes to apply our vast expertise in the design, development and integration of artificial intelligence technologies, bringing it to bear to help develop more realistic entity-level scenarios for USMC simulated training. Most crucial to our work will be the design and development of a full infrastructure, called SERUM (Simulated training Exercises with Robust Unmanned Models) to support advanced AI for the USMC&quot;s simulation technology portfolio. This infrastructure will allow for robust, unmanned entities (Soar-based and otherwise) to exist in both constructive (e.g. OneSAF, JSAF) and virtual (e.g. VBS2) simulation environments simultaneously, and will also include the necessary hooks and mechanisms to allow entities to both perceive the world and make actions within it.   Using SERUM, we will then develop prototype robust intelligent agents (and apply existing agents) that can serve as robust, tactically viable role-players for a particular domain (e.g. JTAC training) that require minimal babysitting and maintenance on the part of scenario operators."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT:The effectiveness of current and future tactical aircraft increasingly depends on their ability to exchange information.Existing waveforms such Common Data Link (CDL) must be enhanced with mesh networking capabilities to meet desired efficiency, flexibility, and reliability requirements. In Phase I, we designed a backward-compatible Mesh Enhanced Tactical Airborne Link (METAL), and thoroughly analyzed the intrinsic tradeoffs arising from the partially upgraded network configuration. We also implemented and evaluated a prototype using IAIs RFnest wireless network emulation hardware and AGI toolkit.Beyond showing the potentially significant improvement in throughput and reliability provided by METAL, these early evaluations in a highly realistic network environment allowed us to identify and design several important enhancements to the topology management, resource allocation and routing functionalities. In Phase II, utilizing the key fundamental design guidelines established during Phase I, along with the additional knowledge regarding the legacy waveforms, we will implement several distributed mechanisms including topology formation, scheduling and routing optimization routines. We will also create a set of detailed, representative evaluation scenarios addressing various edge cases resulting from the heterogeneous network composition and verify the improved network performance benchmarks in two incremental development and evaluation spirals.BENEFIT:With many DOD aircraft aging and their service life extending, combined with downward budgetary pressure, there is a need to cost-effectively enhance existing tactical aircraft instead of developing entirely new tactical platforms.The proposed METAL system can be added as a software-only upgrade to various aircraft current using military communications waveforms (MADL, CDL etc.) such as the F-35.The METAL system will create a significant improvement over legacy systems by removing mission constraints and communication limitations artificially imposed by current waveform design.METAL will retain direct communication capability with legacy nodes.This approach improves network connectivity and performance, instead of causing increased isolation or requiring gateways.In the commercial sector, many point-to-point and spoke-and-hub waveforms are used for cellular communications, wireless data, and other consumer services.Due to increasing consumer data demands, there is a similar drive in the commercial world to improve the efficiency of these networks without requiring new hardware at either the consumer or carrier end.One possible application of METAL is to ease the deployment of microcells and femtocells, small-scale cell towers (e.g. a few hundred meters) that extend coverage and improve spectrum efficiency."

We propose a framework for representing the knowledge and human-quality reasoning required to process large quantities of radar data, transforming it into a form that can be efficiently executed in real time on an HPC system, and then efficiently executing it given the actual dynamic tactical situation.  In addition to being scalable up to a large number of pixels and objects, it should also be adaptable both in the long term to different HPC configurations and in real time to different dynamic computational loads.  In Phase I we will study the urban environment and resulting radar data; determine the tactical reasoning and available information that can be applied to knowledge-based frame-to-frame radar track correlation and vehicle behavior analysis; elaborate the heuristics and algorithms for learning traffic patterns, normalcy, and other knowledge from past data; develop techniques for the automatic translation to a form for HPC hardware; develop real-time HPC resource scheduling techniques; prove the feasibility through prototype development, experimental testing with real radar data, and demonstration; and develop the Phase II system design."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this effort is to improve the performance of the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) including improved space catalog accuracy through more and more complementary tracking, better responsiveness to real-time changes, better tracking of small debris in LEO through efficient use of applicable sensors, efficient tracking of DS frequent revisit objects, handling increased number of objects and new types of sensors, and taking advantage of improved communication and control to globally optimize the SSN schedule.    The next logical step is to develop the full-scale family of SSN schedulers in our current Aurora framework and integrate them with the appropriate SSN systems.  These include the GIG-enabled Tasker Optimizing Scheduler and the scheduling portions of the Next Generation Tasker (NGT), including a LEO frequent revisit optimizing scheduler, a DS frequent revisit optimizing scheduler, and a Global Master Allocator Optimizing Scheduler.  This will require early, frequent, and long-lasting contact with the Next Generation Tasker (NGT) initiative led by the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC\/A9A, letter of support from Colonel Visel included) to ensure full understanding of the requirements, constraints, opportunities, and integration issues.  We also will provide advice and support to the NGT initiative from a resource optimization and scheduling perspective.      BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, the SSN itself including both the Next Generation Tasker (NGT) and the GIG-Enabled Tasker.  Attached is a letter of support from Colonel Visel which says, in part,&quot;Our interactions have convinced us that there are several areas in our NGT effort that could benefit from Stottler Henke&quot;s expertise.  Specifically, we see applicability for their Aurora tool to solve constrained scheduling problems in both frequent-revisit and catalog-maintenance sensor tasking.&quot;By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed Schedulers.  Beyond the Air Force there are several commercialization possibilities available in the government and private sector.  The algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Army and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for SSN scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  For example, the bottleneck avoidance algorithm proposed to be fully developed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

The Spectral Imaging Laboratory (SPILAB) proposes the development of both long wavelength infrared (LWIR) and middle wavelength infrared (MWIR) artificial compound eye (ACE) optical systems that can be coupled to LWIR and MWIR camera modules.  ACE wide angle optics have the benefit of generating high resolution, distortion free images that have uniform intensity across the field. The SPILAB ACE design includes a honeycomb louver baffle that can block stray radiation from bright sources such as the sun and flares.  BENEFIT:  Will provide the military with infrared wide angle seekers that can be used in small weapon\/aircraft systems engaged in combat and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Commercial applications include surveillance activities in law enforcement, search and rescue, border control, and homeland security. Other commercial applications include machine vision for manufacturing, robotics, and vehicle situational awareness\/safety systems."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve the ability of onboard software to predict trajectories of other aircraft in the terminal area of operations.  This ability can only be realized with an automatic capability for recognizing the intent of the pilots of these other aircraft in the complex and dynamic terminal area.  The Phase I prototype absolutely proved the feasibility of using procedure and dialog graphs, fractional dialog grammars and Behavior Transition Networks for ground trajectory prediction, by actually implementing them in software and demonstrating them with actual air traffic control transcripts and simulated sensor data.    The next logical step, as addressed by this proposal, is to develop the full-scale Intelligent Pilot Intent Analysis System (IPIAS) to support autonomous UAV ground operations and integrate it to the degree possible with the appropriate UAV systems currently being developed.  The Phase II IPIAS will analyze text recognized from actual airport ATC-Pilot communications and simulated sensor data to predict routes on the ground for aircraft on the ground, taking off, and landing.  We will coordinate with sibling contractors and the selected prime through early and frequent contact to ensure full understanding of the evolving requirements, constraints, opportunities, and integration issues.     BENEFIT:  The direct target for this effort is UASs operating in the terminal area of operations (TAO).  The primary commercialization plan for IPIAS relative to this domain will be to demonstrate a significant potential for automatic, intelligent pilot intent recognition, thus improving safety related to UASs in the TAO with reduced manning in Phase II.  This will allow us to acquire Phase III funding to transition IPIAS to operational use.  The realization of this capability will create a demand for similar systems for other agencies (i.e. the Army, Navy, and Marines) since they all have UASs.  Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Agency have the similar problem of a growing number of UASs, and the desire to operate them in the TAO."

        "Abstract": "Determining pilot intent is very complex.  Human pilots rely on a myriad of information that includes radio communications, aircraft location and trajectory, airport information (standard landing\/departure patterns, noise abatement procedures, etc.), weather, the capabilities of different aircraft (e.g. take-off\/landing speeds, max climb rate, etc.), instrument and visual flight rules, etc.  Given this complexity, no simple algorithm will suffice.   Human pilots routinely perform this activity, suggesting that what is required is a system based on the way those pilots reason.  Stottler Henke has studied and automated this kind of human decision making for over 20 years and we have already developed techniques in intent recognition that are applicable to this effort.  Our Intelligent Pilot Intent Analysis System (IPIAS) would represent and execute expert pilot reasoning processes to infer other pilots&quot;intents in the same way human pilots currently do.    The goals of the Phase I research are to understand the current and future terminal area of operations environment, elicit the cognitive processes currently used by human pilots to understand each others&quot;intent, elaborate the heuristics, algorithms, and techniques for automatic recognition of pilot intent, prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development, and develop the Phase II system design.

Furthermore many of the pilot intent analysis techniques described are also applicable for determining illegal intent and are therefore directly applicable to finding terrorists and smugglers."

        "Abstract": "The aims and opportunities of our Virtual-Reality-Assessment-Modules(VRAM) for Remote Monitoring and Diagnosis of Warfighters at Risk for PTSD are based upon A2-T2\u2019s existing remote technologies already developed for OSD and commercial customers.  Specifically, this project provides an ideal opportunity to extend our remote enabled TBI screening assessment and rehabilitation technologies along with entirely new classes of advanced video teleconferencing technologies we are developing under commercial contracts into the PTSD domain. Our extensions and evolutions into the PTSD domains will exploit our easy-to-understand, ease-to-use monitoring, screening, and diagnostic interfaces customized for medical staff uses for assessments of return-to-duty status, affective computing (artificial intelligence dynamic adjustment of task difficulty to the type and level of user), and our current audio\/visual assessments built-in to our Internet-Based Rehab prototypes. PTSD-specific parameters are the focus of our scientific and technical efforts. Our multi-modal designs fulfills non-invasive tools requirements associated with providing important information regarding a warfighter\u2019s mental health status through detection and monitoring of biological patterns and\/or signals (e.g. based on normal phone conversations and video-teleconferences) includes advanced hearing and listening screening and diagnoses inclusive of automated audio and\/or video cuing, facial emotional monitoring, along with composite diagnostic scoring based upon solid scientific principles."

        "Abstract": "Existing computer combat wargames offer a sophisticated and high fidelity base platform for accurately modeling standard combat scenarios.  However, the rapid development of UAV capabilities in terms of sizes, weapons, sensors, communications and flight ability is presenting a new challenge for these simulations. At the same time, the general state of world affairs is changing such that the likelihood and impact of UAV\u2019s in operations is greater than ever before.  Thus, the ability to use effective computer modeling and analysis tools in decision-making at all levels is more critical than ever, especially in the development of UAV doctrine, tactics, procurement, design, and integration into force structures and missions.   This project will perform research into improving existing wargame software, specifically the title \u201cPoint of Attack\u201d, in terms of increasing the fidelity and overall usefulness of the program to a full range of military planners, commanders, analysts and other users.  The project\u2019s initial focus will be on enhancing the modeling aspects of the UAV\u2019s themselves, including net-centric considerations and flexibility in allowing for hypothetical future developments.  Additionally, investigations will be made into improving the artificial intelligence (AI) abilities acting on behalf of both itself and\/or a human player.   BENEFIT:  The primary benefits of the proposed model and AI improvements will be that existing and future combat simulations and computer wargames will be more accurate in terms of friendly and enemy force actions involving UAV\u2019s, will offer more challenges to players, and will make them more enjoyable to use\/play.  All of these things will increase the overall employment of the software in whatever capacity it is used, for example as a course of action evaluator on the battlefield, a training tool, an evaluation vehicle for weapons system or doctrine\/tactics development, or as an information device to showcase the effectiveness of new technologies.  The commercial benefits are that more enjoyable computer games can be published, increasing sales, as well as offering developers the opportunity to easily and quickly adjust computer models for specific UAV situations without having to rewrite significant portions of the AI and modeling code.  For example, the same software can model equally well UAV\u2019s used for border monitoring or forest fire detection\/fighting as it can military operations with UAV\u2019s against insurgents."

        "Abstract": "While current Air Force logistics processes have served us well, and provided unparalleled support since the end of the Cold War, the need to significantly reduce costs while improving weapons system availability is essential.  Senior Air Force officials have stated in numerous documents that the Air Force has reached a point where its current way of doing supply chain management (SCM) business, and the systems that support the current process, are limited in their ability to significantly improve readiness beyond the current levels.  Cognition LLC proposes to research and develop a methodology to aid the AF engineer in defining requirements, assigning functions, establishing priorities, and executing engineering decisions to aid in the support of reliability, maintainability, and supportability factors in relevant AF supply chains.  The goal is to increase the productivity, capability, and technical effectiveness of AF system engineers to support legacy aircraft supply chain functions by leading the engineer through the complex activities of multiple-attribute tradeoffs necessary to achieve improved product performance and availability.   The Cognition LLC approach will aid the AF in not only migrating improved System Engineering methodologies into the sustainment process but also implementing tool sets to parse complex availability and performance factors necessary to achieve continued product improvement.  The Cognition LLC developed methodology will assess critical performance attributes (to include requirements, functions, and priorities) and availability attributes (to include reliability, maintainability, supportability, and producibility) to guide the systems engineer to improved functional performance.  The methodology will map and define the relationships between performance and availability attributes and help cultivate enhanced technical understanding that will lead to continued product improvement. This effort will also inform refinements to AFMC\u2019s Sustainment Business Process Model (SBPM).  BENEFIT:  Our goal is to develop and deliver a comprehensive systems engineering methodology  that gives the sustainment community a set of advanced algorithms to optimize performance and availability using requirements, functions, priorities, reliability, maintainability, supportability and producibility as inputs.  Our solution will provide a methodology to parse complex availability and performance attributes to support complex systems engineering and achieve measurable technical effectiveness.  Through the innovative integration of artificial intelligence and emerging technology, our designed capability will map and define the relationships between performance and availability attributes and help cultivate enhanced technical understanding that will lead to continued product improvement..  During Phase II, Cognition LLC will develop a methodology with facilitating algorithms to establish a standardized multi-attribute engineering assessment capability with outstanding commercialization potential."

        "Abstract": "The proposed miniaturized antenna takes advantage of two innovations. These include the novel antenna design concept of coupled sectorial loops and a wideband artificial magnetic conductor substrate utilizing a combination of dielectric and ferromagnetic (ferrite) materials. The proposed antenna technology is capable of providing the omni-directional and directional radiation patterns over extremely wide bandwidths. The ultimate goal is to result in an electrically small antenna with maximum dimensions of 0.03 x 0.03 x 0.01 cubic wavelength with an impedance bandwidth ranging from 30 MHz to 40 GHz. To optimize the antenna placement on targeted vehicles in real environments, full-wave FDTD simulations of the proposed antenna in the presence of a detailed full-scaled model of the mobile platform will be performed. The findings of this process will also be experimentally verified by carrying out measurements on real models of the antenna and its supporting platform. Furthermore, to develop a commercially viable product, a suitable antenna package capable of meeting harsh environmental and physical conditions will be developed."

        "Abstract": "This proposal is for the use of state-of-the-art computer wargames to be used in the research on the impact and optimal use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in realistic combat scenarios.  High fidelity, historically calibrated wargames ranging from sub-tactical ground-centric game engines through operational, strategic, air campaign, and naval-centric game engines will be used to address the full spectrum of UAVs, their capabilities, and optimal use.  These computer wargames all come with a powerful and highly adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability developed over several years of research and development which allows these wargames to be effectively used in both human-interaction and fully-automated settings.  Employing these wargames with this AI feature allows for execution on both interactive and multi-processor computer systems as appropriate for the research being conducted.  BENEFIT:  UAVs have been a very significant military development recently and are poised to significantly impact all combat scenarios from the very tactical to the strategic in all areas of warfare: ground, air, and naval.  As the capabilities of UAVs increases, it is important to anticipate and optimally implement them into combat scenarios.  High-fidelity computer wargames together with powerful and highly adaptive AI functionality can be effectively and efficiently used to pursue research into the use of UAVs.  It is important that these wargames be effectively calibrated so that any results obtained from them can be viewed with a high level of confidence that they are representative of actual situations.  Likewise, it is important that these wargames have both interactive and automated execution modes so that investigations can be carried out both with human-in-the-loop and on high-performance computer systems.  The interactive mode supports discoveries of the use of UAVs that might not be realized and understood while the automated modes supports mathematical optimization of their use."

        "Abstract": "To address the Air Force need for automated fiber optic interconnect cleaning\/inspection, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Efficient Fiber Optic Examination and Cleaning Tool (EFFECT) that combines both the inspection and cleaning processes in an entirely self-contained, body-worn, hand-held device with intuitive operation.  The EFFECT system integrates advanced optics, artificial intelligence, and automated cleaning and debris removal (solvent delivery, debris vacuum, and inert nitrogen gas drying) with a novel adaptor system to accommodate virtually all form factors of fiber optic interconnects.  Body-worn solvent and inert gas reservoirs, a vacuum system, and battery packs allow for operation in tight, confined spaces where aircraft\/vessel power is not readily available and the use of innovative quick-connect adaptors (QCAs) affords the ability to effectively restore functionality in under 1 minute to the various interconnect architectures exposed to contaminants when removing line-replaceable units (LRUs).  In Phase I, POC will define the variables for inspecting and cleaning fiber optic interconnects and fabricate a technology readiness level (TRL)-3 prototype.  In Phase II, a rugged prototype will be demonstrated to show its feasibility to perform terminus endface restoration in realistic military avionics connector environments at TRL-5.  BENEFIT:  The use of fiber optics for data transmission has tremendous applications in both military and commercial environments.  With its many benefits over standard coaxial and copper lines, the use of optical transmission is growing exponentially, particularly in the telecommunication industry, which has invested a considerable amount of money in providing infrastructure directly to consumer households.  Unfortunately the fragility and susceptibility to signal degradation requires continued maintenance that can be time consuming without proper equipment.  EFFECT will greatly help reduce this maintenance burden with an effective system that is efficient and intuitively operated with negligible infrastructure needs."

        "Abstract": "The AFRL and DARPA have an interest in developing a compact, high definition panoramic video camera for deployment on low cost Cube Satellites.  Ideally the camera would have a suitable means for blocking solar stray light and glints, and it would not have any moving parts.  The baseline camera must be versatile enough to transition to other satellites for a variety of purposes.  The following applications would be ideally suited for this type of camera system:  star tracker navigation, satellite near field monitoring for docking and refueling, space debris tracking, intelligence gathering.     The Spectral Imaging Laboratory proposes the development of a high definition artificial compound eye (ACE) derived from natural arthropod compound eyes.  Arthropod compound eyes can acquire wide angle images with zero distortion and an infinite depth of field (all objects are in focus at all ranges).  Video cameras with these characteristics would benefit by eliminating the need for gimbals and focus mechanisms, thereby reducing volume, mass, and potential failure points.     The high definition ACE relies on curved (3D) glass lens arrays.  The purpose of this project is to develop the ability to mold 3D glass lens arrays with sufficiently high surface quality to enable high resolution imaging.  BENEFIT:  This research will result in the ability to mold high quality 3D double sided lens arrays suitable for high resolution imaging.  This capability will enable the development of a distortion free, high definition panoramic camera that does not require focus adjustment.  The optics fabrication is based on a hot press molded, curved lens array technology that is ideally suited for low cost, high volume production.  The principal application is a new type of star tracker that can view to within 5 degrees of the sun.  Other commercial applications include robotic and autonomous wide area surveillance.  Robots will benefit from the wide field of view, infinite depth of field attribute by using it to navigate more reliably through rugged terrain.  The optics will enable real time navigation for autonomous flying robots that use the optical flow field to navigate.  Robots designed to grasp objects will benefit from being able to view objects in focus at every distance."

        "Abstract": "The goal of this proposed effort is to develop a Mid-level Manager (MLM) that automatically handles all aspects associated with GDPAAs, including global optimized assignment of communication requests to the GDPAAs and dish antennas, intelligent smart beam assignment, multi level beam compatibility checking, and beam active area route planning.  The ultimate system should outperform the existing software and human schedulers including better quality schedules; faster scheduling; handling larger, more complex sets of requests; and handling additional communication system capabilities, including multi-beam phased array antennas.  The developed system should show superior performance on AFSCN\/GDPAA scheduling\/route planning problems, and demonstrate significant benefit for human future AFSCN schedulers.  Each of the algorithms should be rigorously analyzed and have its most relevant properties proven, such as correctness, termination, and required conditions.  Integration requirements with ESD will be investigated.  The information content and timing between the MLM and the GDPAA managers will be determined.    BENEFIT:  The most direct target for the results of this effort is, of course, scheduling for the future AFSCN which will include GDPAAs and the other Space Communication Networks (DSN, GN, and SN).  By both demonstrating significantly improved performance during Phase II and ensuring that the ultimate results can be integrated into the operational scheduling systems, the Air Force will have a strong incentive to operationalize the Phase II development of the proposed MLM.  Beyond the Air Force and NASA there are several commercialization possibilities available in the government and private sector.  Additionally, there are many similarities between communication scheduling and sensor scheduling.  Thus the algorithms developed here could be marketed to our existing Air Force and Navy sensor customers interested in sensor scheduling and coordination.  Finally, there are the commercial applications for the technology developed for the Scheduler.  We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for communication scheduling can be synergistically marketed to the same clients.  We anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide and their value."

We can create FORCEnet Engagement Packs (FnEPs) that combine weapons, sensors, mission threads, business process definitions, and simulations via a 4-layer model. Layer 1 overcomes a huge impediment, namely that weapon and sensor platforms were never designed to work with other combinations, by automation tools funded by PEO IWS and ONR: uReuse and uGlue respectively. uReuse analyzes legacy system code to classify how to expose information and operations as services. uGlue creates graphs to transform disparate data models from different systems to work with each other, based on a data registry that uses fuzzy matching, data mining, and ontological inference. We can add many information sources: SOAP, REST, JMS, DDS, IRC, CORBA, SQL, \u2026. In Layer 2 an operator can manually combine business process templates and rules to form FnEPs. Layer 3 supports semi-automated FnEP creation by adding intelligent BP reconfiguration through goal-planning artificial intelligence (AI) methods, using predicate logic and programming and situation calculus concepts, and learning to be self-modifying. Layer 4 matures layer 3, adding automated threat and intent recognition to realize an Automated Battle Management Aid (ABMA)."

        "Abstract": "The development of an automated ride control system for high speed combatant  craft is critical to reducing the motions that cause injury to crew and damage to craft and equipment.  Ancillary benefits include reduced fuel consumption for improved range of operation and the reduction of wake signature.  The objective of this research project is to continue the successful development of ride control systems for high speed combatant craft with the goals of improving motion-reducing performance  through the use of not-currently-implemented predictive features that rely on data from additional on-board sensors and real time sea condition models, and additional not-currently-implemented system automation to reduce operator task load. BENEFITS: Ride control systems are well-proven in commercial and military applications.  The company proposing this work has successfully fielded ride control systems for relatively small, very high speed combatant craft with impressive results.  For example, one application reduced the peak motions-induced shock acceleration on a 11m US Navy RHIB by approximately 50% (from over 12 g\u2019s to less than 6 g\u2019s), and the company\u2019s ride control system is currently being fitted to every new UK MOD high speed special operations craft.  It is believed that further sea-induced motion reductions, with commensurate reductions of injury-causing acceleration can be achieved by (a) using data from additional on-board sensors such as radar or radio-frequency wave height telemetry and (b) using data from sea condition models that are updated in real-time by the ride control system embedded controller.  Neither approach is currently implemented anywhere in the world as a control input to the ride control system, and mathematical models and control algorithms must be developed to achieve the goal of improved performance.  The anticipated benefits of a system employing these features is improved system performance with little increase in system price, which is an aspect that is very important for follow-on commercial applications.  That is, excluding the one-time cost of developing models and algorithms, taking input from craft radar or radio-frequency wave height telemetry is merely a systems integration issue rather than additional hardware scope of supply requirement because the candidate craft, whether military or commercial, are always fitted with radar units, and current generation ride control systems are always fitted with conventional motion sensors such as accelerometers, rate gyros, and inclinometers.  Further, it is believed that current-generation embedded processors with adequate computational power are commercially available to simultaneously update sea condition models in real time and run the ride control system algorithms in real time. Another aspect of the work being proposed is increased automation to reduce operator task load.  Most current generation ride control systems require the operator to change system settings in response to prevailing sea conditions.  Some current generation ride control systems have adaptive algorithms, which merely use a gain scheduling approach that is crude and ineffective for high speed craft.  The company proposing this work has investigated integration of an artificial intelligence engine into the ride control system, but performance models indicate that the \u201clearning time\u201d is too long for high speed craft operating in confused sea conditions.  However, taking data from additional on-board sensors, such as radar or radio-frequency wave-height telemetry, would decrease \u201clearning time\u201d and provide better motions-reducing performance without the operator having to manually change system settings.  As above, the anticipated benefits of a system employing this feature is improved system performance with little increase in system price, which is an aspect that is very important for follow-on commercial applications.  That is, excluding the one-time cost of developing models and algorithms, taking input from craft radar is merely a systems integration issue rather than additional hardware scope of supply requirement."

        "Abstract": "Course of action (COA) analysis, especially adversary reaction prediction, that occurs during the Joint Operation Planning Process\/Joint Air Estimate Process (JOPP\/JAEP) has benefited by applying advanced computing algorithms. Typically though, algorithms have been narrowly applied to solve niche issues within broader JOPP\/JAEP tasks. The concept of hybrid architectures seeks to provide a more holistic approach. With hybrid architectures, tasks are decomposed into subtasks that are assigned an algorithm suitable to performing that subtask. Hybrid architectures may be constructed from a variety of algorithms, and typically multiple algorithms can be applied to a general classification of problem. However, although the classification may be similar, the problem constraints imposed by the current situation in which decisions must be made vary greatly. To address these challenges, Securboration is teaming with artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eugene Santos from Dartmouth College to develop the Virtual Hybrid Architecture Computing System or VHACS. In Phase I of this effort, the Securboration Team will develop the VHACS prototype that determines appropriate algorithms to satisfy given subtasks within the current operational environment and then composes them into a specification that it invokes for a distributed execution. VHACS combines the benefits of traditional hybrid architectures with the reach, flexibility, and reusability of netcentric concepts.  BENEFIT:  VHACS presents a series of interesting initial commercialization opportunities that will be explored, and subsequently refined, over the course of this research. The approaches taken in VHACS to automate hybrid execution through distributed discovery and composition and applying the results to solve complex problems have utility to a variety of commercial applications. The four most prominent include: 1) Logistics \u2013 algorithms that focus on optimization can be combined with other algorithms to understand the propagating cascading effects that logistics contributes to, 2) Gaming \u2013 algorithms and techniques developed for VHACS can be embedded into gaming engines (including military) to incorporate a more dynamic\/realistic behavior based on \u2018composite\u2019 algorithms. Especially with distributed gaming approaches, VHACS can dynamically alter the algorithms that comprise the executable hybrid architecture package to modify the behavior of virtual entities etc., 3) World Banking \u2013 VHACS can invoke hybrid algorithms to understand how regional behaviors rapidly change based on perceptions of U.S. actions taken, VHACS could be used to understand regional stability issues that are of great concern to the world banking community, 4) Strategic Business Analysis \u2013there is a very close analogy between understanding an enemy, his likely courses of action and developing a plan to defeat him to that of understanding a business competitor, his likely aggressive business actions and developing a strategic business plan to dominate in a discrete business domain. It is clear that this research could significantly improve, or perhaps even supplant, current business analysis and planning techniques such as SWOT analysis."

        "Abstract": "Complex wireless ad hoc networks present unique and substantial challenges in the presence of faults, and unlike wire networks, faults are typically transient and quite common. In response to these challenges, QuickFlex, Inc. proposes QuickMANet, a novel fault management, diagnosis, and self-healing system for wireless ad hoc networks. QuickMANet uses distributed, cooperating management nodes in the virtual hierarchy that enables a global fault status perspective even on very large wireless ad hoc networks, including those with mobile elements. The system relies on real-time network modeling of potential faults as fault signatures are observed in the operating network. The modeling helps to define the search space relevant to a particular observed signature, and this information is then used to drive an artificial intelligence-based diagnosis and self-healing response capability. The QuickMANet concept is highly scalable, adaptable, protocol-independent, and spans both wired and wireless networks."

        "Abstract": "Historically speaking, subjectivity was mostly considered as problematic and undesirable. Recently, the availability of the inherently subjective folksonomies has made it readily apparent that inherent subjectivity is highly desirable and that it can be accounted for and utilized by superimposing multiple structures onto data without requiring changes to the underlying data, thus addressing users\u2019 desires to organize data according to their own preferences. 21st Century systems, Incorporated is pleased to propose to research and develop our FolksART concept. This concept automates selected aspects of folksonomy-based, domain-independent contextual reasoning designed to reflect users\u2019 subjective preferences. It involves a rigorous formal notion of context and application and further development of two types of emerging Artificial Intelligence technologies: (1) Hybrid natural language processing, and (2) Natural language-based knowledge representation and reasoning. The project accounts for many types of high-level contextual reasoning, including contextual taxonomic inference and contextual classification. The approach is tested on rich user-tagged image and textual data in many different domains."

This SBIR project will investigate, develop, and deploy a web-based software system (called PolARES) that supports key decisions for crisis management and battlefield applications.  This system will produce a revolutionary improvement in decision performance for both experienced and novice decision makers. Successful crisis decision-making employs a psychology termed recognition-primed decision-making, a method that uses limited event observations to force quick recognition of an analogous scenario from a knowledge base.  The PolARES decision system will support rapid decision-making in battlefield, emergency, and disaster situations. PolARES will include an extensive relational database of decision scenarios: event\/decision pairs tailored to a target decision maker and decision space. PolARES will employ an advanced artificial intelligence algorithm to lead the decision maker through a limited set of questions to a rapid choice of a stored scenario. The tool will then adapt the base scenario to actual event conditions.  A feasibility prototype demonstrated PolARES\u2019 potential for chemical emergency response in Phase I of this SBIR.  In Phase 2, PolARES will be applied to tactical military decision-making and other crisis decision environments."

This will be accomplished through analysis, simulation, practical experience, intuition and experimentation, with the aid of artificial intelligence, primarily in the form of genetic algorithms, to help refine the concepts.  The general approach will be to develop blast protection materials and structures that defocus and redirect the blast impulse so that the negative effects on the vehicle passengers and the vehicle itself are minimized.  In order to examine and refine the concepts, we plan to perform dynamic simulations, coupled with genetic algorithms.  The simulations will have both numeric and graphical animation outputs.  To validate the simulations, lab tests and field tests will be conducted."

        "Abstract": "Military deployment practices necessarily separate families, and therefore inflict significant psychological stress, particularly in young children. Readily available contact with the deployed parent could reduce stress on the child. That reduction could in turn improve the service member\u2019s resiliency by reducing family stress. Artificial intelligence and game technologies can be applied to support virtual interactions when the parent is not available, but several key challenges must be overcome to attain a workable solution. For the child, the system must be comforting, easy to use, and engaging, while avoiding any possible psychological harm. For the parent, it must provide guidance for rapidly and intuitively generating personalized content, while engendering trust in its content and security. To address these challenges, we propose to design a Virtual Interactive Parent (VIP) System for providing on-demand synthetic parent interactions to comfort left-behind family members\u2014particularly young children\u2014during stressful periods. VIP focuses on three components: 1) an Interaction Template Library of familiar, comforting interaction \u201cscenes\u201d that parents fill with personalized content; 2) a VIP Application for the child to communicate and play within these \u201cscenes\u201d; and 3) Secure Content Management Tools supporting parents as they personalize content and enjoy the child\u2019s interaction with that content."

        "Abstract": "An effective Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) must be able to make decisions that maximize engagement success\u2014the destruction of critical missile threats\u2014while doing so in an efficient manner so as not to waste critical defense assets that may be needed to handle further threats. However, such decisions are often made and carried out at more localized subsystems, allowing for increased robustness and faster response time. This distribution of decision making makes achieving global optimization goals more difficult, as it requires that defense subsystems and components work together effectively. Aware of these issues, MDA is seeking solutions for aiding in the development of robust, real-time battle management algorithms and software to support layered missile defense. EDAptive Computing, Inc. team proposes ADROIT, which will result in an innovative and commercially viable prototype system whose architecture and processes will maximize engagement success while optimizing inventories. Through innovative Artificial Intelligence algorithms embedded into a flexible and intuitive simulation framework, ADROIT can facilitate the development of robust and effective battle management systems, and potentially other complex decision making applications."

        "Abstract": "Today\u2019s contemporary operating environment is filled with potential adversaries that exhibit a variety of individual and coordinated behaviors.  Proper response to these behaviors has become a critical training requirement for Soldiers and a variety of commercial gaming technologies have been proposed to provide the requisite training environment.  Where gaming technologies can be used to create engaging experiences, they typically lack the realism needed to properly portray the COE without significant modifications.  Behaviors of non-player entities is a particularly acute problem as most gaming artificial intelligence is either limited or is targeted at making a game challenging and fun rather than realistic.   Investments made by the DoD in AI technologies has produced a far more accurate and representative repository of the types of behaviors needed to represent the COE.  Integrating these with gaming technologies has great potential to solve current training gaps.  Forterra proposes to directly integrate its distributed, multi-player game platform through the SORD interface with OneSAF to produce a highly scalable, persistent, distributed virtual training system suitable for training in the COE.  We propose a design in Phase I with a feasibility demonstration as an option, and a full integration in Phase II."

Innovative solutions that highlight and track corrosion issues are required in order to enhance the maintainer\u2019s ability in the prevention, inspection, removal and treatment of corrosion and information management. This proposal describes an approach utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Statistical methods that the authors have successfully utilized in predicting the deterioration of Navy ship tank and void services and Army\/ Marine Corp wheeled vehicles. In addition, the methods we created for aircraft inspection and data mining of the resulting depot level scoring, induction inspections and maintenance for the Navy and Air Force will also be used in the development of an Aircraft Corrosion Prediction and Simulation software tool. This tool will predict and display the corrosion hotspots on the aircraft as they evolve. The proposed technology should result in substantial decreases in maintenance costs associated with detecting, repairing, and tracking corrosive areas."

        "Abstract": "Current computer combat simulation software offers a sophisticated and high fidelity platform in terms of modeling and accurate results. \u00a0However, simulation development towards insurgent, terrorist, and other asymmetric warfare has lagged due to difficulties in managing the complexity and variety of these types of situations as well as relative historical lack of interest in these scenarios. \u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the general state of world affairs has changed so that these situations are the major threat faced by the United States. \u00a0This trend will likely increase, as information technology increases the recruitment and control of hostile elements, and high-tech weapons become easier to acquire. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This project will address several areas of improvement necessary to model these actions using existing wargame software. \u00a0It will model the effects of the weapons (including improvised) and hostile forces themselves (including command and control capabilities, tactics, and ability to inflict damage from a distance). \u00a0Additional work will focus on the role of civilians, detection of radioactive sources, and the development of artificial intelligence (AI). \u00a0The AI will be capable of both acting on behalf of a non-standard force, as well as countering the actions of one in command of a conventional power. \u00a0\u00a0  BENEFIT: The primary benefits of the proposed improvements will be that existing and future combat simulations and computer wargames will be more accurate in terms of friendly and enemy force actions, and will allow for a wider range of events including asymmetric and terrorist actions. \u00a0Additionally, the software will offer more challenges to players, civilian and military alike, making it more enjoyable to play. \u00a0All of which will increase the overall use of the software, no matter how it is being employed. \u00a0For example as entertainment, as a training tool, as an evaluation vehicle for weapons system or tactics development, as a showcase for the effectiveness of new technologies, or even as the basis for further research and development into the next generation of simulation software. \u00a0The commercial benefits are more enjoyable computer games leading to increased sales, as well as offering simulation developers the opportunity to lower development costs by using the enhanced computer models as-is, or with quick and easy changes. \u00a0For example, the same software can be used equally well in an entertainment wargame to model the WWII D-day invasion as modern operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u00a0Or, when used as a professional or occupational tool the same code can model the detection of radioactive material coming though a port in a container ship or an attack on a nuclear plant."

        "Abstract": "While current Air Force logistics processes have served us well, and provided unparalleled support since the end of the Cold War, the need to significantly reduce costs while improving weapons system availability is essential. \u00a0Senior Air Force officials have stated in numerous documents that the Air Force has reached a point where its current way of doing supply chain management (SCM) business, and the systems that support the current process, are limited in their ability to significantly improve readiness beyond the current levels. \u00a0As such, the Air Force is pursuing continuous improvement as the engine that drives transformation. \u00a0Significant change in sustainment support to the warfighter is a key component in the overall transformation initiatives being pursued by Air Force Material Command. \u00a0The lack of a comprehensive, technology transition decision support system to standardize reverse engineering, technology insertion, and technology redesign are critical areas of investigation. \u00a0Cognition LLC will develop and deliver a framework to aid in a standardized systems engineering decision support tool set. \u00a0The solution will employ the Rational Unified Process framework to define a tailored mechanism for iterative product engineering, effective management of changes and clear traceability of operational requirements to the design solution. This effort will also inform refinements to AFMCs Sustainment Business Process Model (SBPM.  BENEFIT: Our goal is to develop and deliver a comprehensive decision support capability which gives the sustainment community a tool set that is easy to learn and easy to use. \u00a0Our solution will provide Trends\/Patterns\/Engineering Analysis to support complex systems engineering. \u00a0Through the innovative integration of artificial intelligence and emerging technology, our designed capability will enhance synergy of reverse engineering, technology insertion, technology redesign, models, tools, methods and planning. \u00a0A fully functioning decision support system designed specifically for systems engineering applications, with a fully integrated inductive reasoning Case Model Generator (CMG), has outstanding commercialization potential."

        "Abstract": "This project is intended to create a top down, effects based simulation set at the air unit level (from individual aircraft to larger mission packages) in which Fifth Generation Fighter Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) can be evaluated. The model will simulate air operations at the level of air mission packages, with individual aircraft modeled within this context. The intent is to create scenarios which will generate unique TTPs that can then be tested and applied as doctrine. Friendly, enemy and civilian forces will be represented by artificial intelligence (AI) agents. Information will be represented from the point of view of individual pilots, mission commanders, and the big picture of an entire operation. Each agent will be motivated by quantitative and qualitative factors. For aircraft this would include flight handling characteristics, pilot training, and networking systems. The simulation will be able to both train individual pilots in operating via TTPs, and to provide doctrinal personnel with a model through which new TTPs could be developed. There will also be a networking capability to allow for larger scenarios in which numerous utilizers could be trained, and higher echelon TTPs be evaluated and developed.  BENEFIT: A successfully completed project will provide the end user with a fully extensible and scalable training application that will provide an immersive training experience in which Fifth Generation Fighter tactics can be rehearsed and developed. Players will interact with a customized environment that will mimic the real world fighter tactical environment. This can be applied to military, law enforcement, emergency service and air traffic control situations."

        "Abstract": "In the proposed Phase II effort, we will create a new framework and runtime infrastructure for GAI development called the Semantic Integration Framework for Intelligent Systems (SIFIS).  SIFIS will consist of an integrated set of middleware and development tools that enable semantic modeling of component-based GAI systems.  SIFIS will increase development productivity in intelligent systems through increasing reuse, facilitating evolutionary and iterative development.  By providing a basis for reasoning about individual system components and capabilities, the resultant tools and languages will allow rapid analysis, adaptation and reintegration during the course of intelligent systems development. SIFIS will leverage IAI\u2019s Distributed Control Framework (DCF) to enable semantic composition in component-based robotic systems.  The proposed Phase II development effort will pave the way towards a unified knowledge and concept representation across all abstraction and modeling levels, enabling semantic integration of large-scale general artificial intelligence systems."

        "Abstract": "RNI with team member Technical Solutions, Inc. (TSI\/TERI) is proposing a unique integrated solution to this problem.  An innovative effort to design, develop and demonstrate Multi-Modal Interfaces for Synthetic Training Environments for effective training.  The system will allow live humans as team or squad leaders to utilize a suite of interface devices to control and interact with automated forces and the simulation environment.   It is well known that small teams of dismounts often use non-verbal communications to direct subordinates.  These \u201cgestures\u201d may also be repeated to by sub-commanders to other team members.  Similarly, non-verbal responses may be used providing full 2-way communication of key tactical methods and status within the team.  Current semi-automated force (SAF) applications do not include non-verbal communication capabilities and often have limited or poor world response and interaction capabilities.   World interaction includes any number of items such as the ability to \u201cuse\u201d a light switch or recognize potential danger indicated by an opened door or broken window. The proposed concept addresses the limitations of current systems artificial intelligence (AI) and input devices available for humans-in-the-loop.  The concept also allows full functionality in software without requiring use of specialized equipment."

        "Abstract": "Mine countermeasures is an important aspect of Navy reconnaissance interests and reliable mine detection still remains a challenge. For automatic mine detection in underwater sonar applications, research has indicated that the identifying the context of the scene will improve the recognition performance. Further, there is a need to constantly update and modify the representative knowledge base with information from new target and background samples. Based on advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence and their sophisticated applications to intelligent imaging solutions, we propose an Incremental Knowledge Assimilator that can identify the environmental context in the scene and optimally incorporates new and relevant data samples into the knowledge base (classifier) in an incremental fashion with minimal memory and computation requirements. The incremental learning algorithm is designed to facilitate concept drift. Since the goal of the system is to learn perpetually, it lays higher stress on learning the patterns the each mode of the distribution (or each class) rather than focusing merely on the separation of classes. We present preliminary performance results to validate our methodology."

        "Abstract": "Course of action (COA) analysis, especially adversary reaction prediction, that occurs during the Joint Operation Planning Process\/Joint Air Estimate Process (JOPP\/JAEP) has benefited by applying advanced computing algorithms. Typically though, algorithms have been narrowly applied to solve niche issues within broader JOPP\/JAEP tasks. The concept of hybrid architectures seeks to provide a more holistic approach. With hybrid architectures, tasks are decomposed into subtasks that are assigned an algorithm suitable to performing that subtask. Hybrid architectures may be constructed from a variety of algorithms, and typically multiple algorithms can be applied to a general classification of problem. However, although the classification may be similar, the problem constraints imposed by the current situation in which decisions must be made vary greatly. To address these challenges, Securboration is teaming with artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eugene Santos from Dartmouth College to develop the Virtual Hybrid Architecture Computing System or VHACS. In Phase I of this effort, the Securboration Team will develop the VHACS prototype that determines appropriate algorithms to satisfy given subtasks within the current operational environment and then composes them into a specification that it invokes for a distributed execution. VHACS combines the benefits of traditional hybrid architectures with the reach, flexibility, and reusability of netcentric concepts.  BENEFIT: VHACS presents a series of interesting initial commercialization opportunities that will be explored, and subsequently refined, over the course of this research. \u00a0The approaches taken in VHACS to automate hybrid execution through distributed discovery and composition and applying the results to solve complex problems have utility to a variety of commercial applications. The four most prominent include: 1) Logistics algorithms that focus on optimization can be combined with other algorithms to understand the propagating cascading effects that logistics contributes to, 2) Gaming algorithms and techniques developed for VHACS can be embedded into gaming engines (including military) to incorporate a more dynamic\/realistic behavior based on composite algorithms. Especially with distributed gaming approaches, VHACS can dynamically alter the algorithms that comprise the executable hybrid architecture package to modify the behavior of virtual entities etc., 3) World Banking VHACS can invoke hybrid algorithms to understand how regional behaviors rapidly change based on perceptions of U.S. actions taken, VHACS could be used to understand regional stability issues that are of great concern to the world banking community, 4) Strategic Business Analysis there is a very close analogy between understanding an enemy, his likely courses of action and developing a plan to defeat him to that of understanding a business competitor, his likely aggressive business actions and developing a strategic business plan to dominate in a discrete business domain. It is clear that this research could significantly improve, or perhaps even supplant, current business analysis and planning techniques such as SWOT analysis."

        "Abstract": "Max Headroom two decades ago captured the imaginations of millions with his energy and the concept of an artificial intelligence (AI) able to communicate and interact with humans. Now we can use technological improvements in AI and computer graphics for movies and games to create an AI character that can be realistically driven by responses to spoken questions and interact with people in a realistic fashion. The Virtual Iconic Presence can be tailored by software and training to represent a wide range of religious, cultural and ethnographic qualities, creating interactive \u201cIcons\u201d with personality, mannerisms and attributes associated with geographic regions, political movements or ethnic populations. This combines techniques from  animation, voice recognition, AI, and real time video graphics to create an interactive artificially intelligent virtual presence to support training and mission rehearsal\/experimentation areas within the DoD. Tailoring features and speech makes our solution applicable to both training and delivering a message. This same technology could be used for educational purposes. Medical information is better received and retained by being delivered by a face, rather than written instructions especially if the talking head can answer questions."

        "Abstract": "The need to fight and control the urban terrain is not a new concept for the military; however, there are new obstacles, illustrated in the battles fought and won in Fallujah and Haditha, that make the job of the warfighter much harder. Due to the pioneering work of researchers in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence, there exist promising and significant opportunities for the incorporation of semi-autonomous robotic entities within the small-unit tactical team that may positively impact the day to day effectiveness of the team. To achieve this vision, we propose to develop a system for Coordinating with Humans by Adjustable-autonomy for Multirobot Pursuit (CHAMP).  The robots and humans will be controlled by distributed optimization strategies, derived from results in distributed pursuit, distributed constraint optimization, and dynamic game theory. The degree of operator control will be dynamic, and will be informed by recent results from the field of adjustable autonomy. Finally, the control strategies will be determined by a Cognitive Work Analysis.  The CHAMP approach will allow the coordination of the robotic team to become more dynamic and adjust to the goals, demands, and constraints of the current situation as it unfolds."

        "Abstract": "Soldiers coping with injuries such as Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (MCI\/TBI) are in need of innovative solutions that will attempt to make their daily functioning easier while gaining independence. Even though soldiers with such injuries may be high functioning in some aspects of life, they still require a compensatory strategy for performing activities of daily living.  The CAMRIS\/CogniFit team will develop the initial plan, concept design and illustration for an interactive, low cost, effective cognitive interface system to support soldiers living with minor cognitive impairments.  The Personal Autominder Coach Enhancement (PACE) system will focus on supporting some activities of daily living and provide assistance in self health maintenance by identifying each user&apos;s cognitive weaknesses. The proposed PACE system will interact with Autominder (Pollack 2006) developed for both older adults and with patients of various ages who have traumatic brain injury using advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques. We intend to enhance on the psychosocial aspects of health provider and patient interaction by using a \u201cpersonal coach\u201d approach that will include trust and affect, which have been shown to change treatment outcomes.  We concur with the fact that augmenting trust between human users and machines have also been shown to influence the combined system performance. Our approach incorporates techniques used in building computational social agents (Miller, 2004) to encourage meaningful human-system interactions. By building a training routine based on user weaknesses, we believe we will create a significant improvement in overall functioning of MCI soldiers."

        "Abstract": "Missile defense takes place in an unpredictable, real-time environment and thus requires an adaptive approach to optimization that dynamically allocates sensors and their supporting resources in response to changing goals and constraints. Here, we propose a system of Arbitrage Look-ahead Agents for Market-based Optimization (ALAMO) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. This negotiation mechanism and the agents\u2019 bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. We extend market-based optimization using arbitrage look-ahead agents to turn this approach into a non-myopic planning algorithm, which provides computational gains, more efficient allocations of sensor tasks, and risk management framework that hedges against uncertainty."

        "Abstract": "The proposed miniaturized antenna takes advantage of two innovations. These include the novel antenna design concept of coupled sectorial loops and a wideband artificial magnetic conductor substrate utilizing a combination of dielectric and ferromagnetic (ferrite) materials. At its lowest frequency of operation, a coupled sectorial loop antenna (CSLA) can be designed to have maximum dimensions of 0.1\u00a3fm\u201ee0.35\u00a3fm (where \u00a3fm is the wavelength at the lowest frequency of operation) with impedance bandwidths in excess of 10:1. In this proposed work, we will take advantage of the wideband properties offered by the CSLA concept and utilize various modified miniaturized versions of this antenna as the starting point to further decrease its lowest frequency of operation (or equivalently its electrical dimensions). Moreover, we will utilize a wideband artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) substrate and a composite feeding scheme to even further reduce the lowest frequency of operation of the antenna without increasing its occupied area. This will result in an electrically small antenna with maximum dimensions of 0.05\u00a3f0\u201ee0.15\u00a3f0 with an impedance bandwidth ranging from 300 MHz to 3.0 GHz."

        "Abstract": "As military equipment becomes more sophisticated and complex, missions become significantly more cognitively demanding.  In order to achieve the objective of preventing errors and reducing cognitive demands on military personnel, a system is needed that is able to assess and predict operator stress, attention and overload states and provide adaptive aiding to maintain the operator in a state of maximal situation awareness and response readiness.  Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop an adaptive aiding system that uses a combination of performance and situational awareness assessments to tune the sensor integration algorithm to detect expected future states of cognitive overload, high levels of stress, and high and low levels of task-focused attention.  The system will be based on three wearable devices that contain a total of nine wireless psychophysiological sensors.  This project focuses on three key aspects of the system design: 1) comparing the efficiency and utility of Fisher Discriminant Analysis and artificial neural networks for integrating sensor data; 2) comparing two operator modeling systems (dynamic event-triggered pattern analysis and the Dynamic Integration Diagram) for predicting operator functional state based on psychophysiological, performance and environmental data; and 3) designing an adaptive aiding interface for assisting operators prior to cognitive overload."

(IAI) proposes to develop the Warfighter Wiki, an innovative approach to collect, store, and present informal knowledge that today is commonly placed in continuity folders. Informal knowledge includes heuristics and knowledge that is tied to particular work situations. While the DoD manages formal knowledge well (in manuals, schoolhouse training, and promotion tests), situated job knowledge is left to expert field users to collect, and to pass on to others who need to learn it.  IAI\u2019s expertise in Instructional Design, Web-based technologies, and Artificial Intelligence will enable us to build powerful tools so that the Warfighter Wiki can manage informal knowledge in a very efficient and effective process. Key advantages of our approach are that we are adding features to a tool (a wiki) that already possesses many of the requirements for an informal knowledge repository. We collect content in a structured way, so that job aiding content can also be used for job training. We will build tools using advanced technologies to help users create or refine their job knowledge content. Finally, we are keenly aware that any system that will supplant continuity folders must be easy to use, and must address users\u2019 privacy concerns."

        "Abstract": "High quality decisions in military and commercial operations often require the combined intelligence of multiple agents, whose knowledge, expertise, and capabilities are complementary.  Cooperative decision making and problem solving is hard for people who have different languages, priorities, and incentives, and is even more difficult with the participation of non-human agents with inscrutable behaviors to people. A fundamental challenge is in developing artificial agents that collaborate in a natural way with humans in order to utilize individual expertise to benefit the whole. Our innovation is a shared intelligence framework, a constrained, but still widely-applicable, role of human agent collaboration (HAC), for managing human-agent teams and ultimately facilitating both human-agent cooperative tasks and human-to-human activity coordination. Our approach addresses the overall problem of cooperative intelligent behavior by splitting it into two sections, where collaborative decision-making falls on the shoulders of human experts who work together (possibly through agent intermediaries), but where the generation and flexible adaptation of the expert team is conducted through HAC."

        "Abstract": "Navy operational mission planning teams plan offensive strike operations using antiquated, manual processes.  Current Navy developments include automated mission planning at the platform level (E-2D, F\/A-18, EA-6B) and at the Joint Forces Air Component Commander \u2013 JFACC level.  Automated planning tools for offensive strike planning at the Airwing level do not exist.  Monterey Technologies, Inc. (MTI) and Stottler Henke Associates, Inc. (SHAI), as a joint venture, propose to design and develop the prototype of a modern Offensive Air Planning System (OAPS) to fill this gap.  This proposal is for the work of Spiral one for a period of fifteen months of a two spiral project.  Discussion of Spiral two provides a context of the complete project.  OAPS will fill the need for automated mission planning between the tactical platform level and the JFACC level and will be compatible with the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) architecture.  OAPS will be an application of artificial-intelligence symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning approaches that encode data and expertise about weapon systems, adversary system models, and configurable plan templates.  Symbolic representations will enable powerful and extensible encoding of the system&apos;s knowledge base and heuristic knowledge from human planners will empower OAPS to find near-optimal solutions quickly."

        "Abstract": "To address the Air Force need for a target damage\/kill assessment sensor for high-energy laser (HEL) weapon systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) is developing a Holographic-Optical-Element-Based Damage Assessment (HOEDA) system. Based on sensor and data fusion of three laser remote-sensing (polarimetry, vibrometry, and spectroscopy) modules, HOEDA is based on optics of a single telescope using innovative holographic optics and physics-based software models (algorithms). The system provides accurate and reliable damage assessment (from predamage to kill) in targets hit by HEL weapon systems. While operating at standoff distances of up to 200 km from military aircraft at altitudes &gt;25,000 feet, the system offers submillisecond response (real time) to provide feedback for lethal\/less-lethal operation of both strategic and tactical HEL systems.  In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the HOEDA system by modeling and simulations and by assembling and laboratory testing a TRL-4 prototype using simulated damaged targets. In Phase II, POC plans to assemble an optimized, fully functional, low power consuming"

        "Abstract": "Current military M&amp;S systems for training and experimentation rely on encoded human behavior models (HBMs) that must be produced and maintained by teams of subject matter experts (SMEs) and professional knowledge engineers (KEs) in an arrangement that can be time-consuming and expensive.  The programming by demonstration (PBD) and machine learning paradigms offer solutions, but are not without challenges, typically producing behaviors that are too simple for operational use, require extensive supplementation by a KE and\/or require large sets of examples.  Soar Technology has formed a team rich in experience with Navy modeling and simulation, HBM development, artificial intelligence, and serious games for training to propose HBM DEPOT, a tool that supplements simulation-based demonstrations with a novel and intuitive guided after-action whiteboarding session based on existing research and tools.  This will result in a system that captures demonstrations of Navy Aviation tactics using a low-cost Delta 3D Navy flight simulator and supplements them with an easy to use diagrammatic representation (pre-loaded with Navy Aviation general domain knowledge) and learning algorithm to generate high-quality HBMs.   The HBMs will be suitable for use in any virtual environment where intelligent computer generated forces (CGFs) or non-player characters (NPCs) such as a wingman or sophisticated OPFOR are required."

        "Abstract": "For effective training in higher-level decision-making and social-interaction skills, there is a need for computer game technology to provide more realistically human-like non-player characters.   As a cost-effective path for integrating greater social-cultural realism into game simulations, we propose a set of AI (Artificial Intelligence) Middleware layers that allow easy extensibility and configuration at a variety of levels of abstraction in game designs.  We plan to determine an appropriate game concept and engine, create AI Middleware that is particularly geared toward social-cultural human behavior, and develop an example game instantiation of the design.  The implemented game engine will have a relatively open architecture, and plug-in application programmer interfaces (APIs) that provide control of non-player characters (NPCs) in standard ways as well as in ways specific for the modeling of social-cultural human behavior.  The system will support alternative human behavior architectures, and provide scripting and behavior-modeling interfaces to allow rapid development of simple and\/or well-understood behavior models, but also provide an appropriate migration path for developers (and possibly end users) to improve the models in the areas where more sophistication is desirable."

        "Abstract": "Army perceives precision guidance and battlefield awareness as crucial technologies for the future and Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) forms an important component of these technologies. Specifically, tactical target recognition in air-to-ground infrared imagery will increase the lethality of precision guided missiles and reduce fratricide. However, recognition is difficult when the variations in atmospheric conditions and background cause the clutter\/target models to behave significantly different from their statistical patterns. Thus, there is a need to constantly update and modify the representative knowledge base with information from new target and clutter samples while retaining non-redundant information. Based on advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence and their sophisticated applications to intelligent imaging solutions, we propose an Incremental Knowledge Assimilation system to optimally incorporate new and relevant data samples into the knowledge base (adaptive bagging based decision forest classifier) in an incremental fashion with minimal memory and computation requirements. Since the goal of the system is to learn perpetually, it lays higher stress on learning the patterns the each mode of the distribution (or each class) rather than focusing merely on the separation of classes. We present preliminary performance results to validate our methodology."

The proposed design will implement a symphony of AI techniques, led by an agent \/ machine learning shadow that parallels each user as they work and conducts the transition of data between domains.  Above the user\/desktop level, yet still utilizing desktop processor resources across a monitoring network, will be distributed trend analysis and other AIs for analyzing the activities of social networks of users.  Automated CAO intervention requests will be made for unresolvable data.  Transfer will be tabled pending review.  We will develop a policy tool to enable broad adoption across agencies with different security policies.  The focus of the effort will be on realizing a high level of assurance for information passing between security levels, realizing accountability, and providing a high resolution enterprise-wide data emissions profile, while being as unobtrusive as possible.  Essentially, we will provide a controlled environment in which we can trust authorized users to decide which data to transition and yet monitor them for malicious behavior."

        "Abstract": "The development of a practical, easily-implemented device that can extend the lifetimes of existing diode lasers would lead to extended service and lower costs and cost-of-ownership. Such a device extends the lifetimes of diode lasers by shutting off the supply current when formation of a potentially damaging current filament appears likely. This allows the diode to return to its initial state with no memory of filamentation. We have artificially generated optical transients by applying current pulses atop the normal, regulated drive currents of laser diodes to observe the result of such aberrant behavior of the laser\u2019s properties and lifetime. We have studied the optical and electrical behavior to correlate excursions in both that indicate performance-degrading faults. The plan is to use such optical transients as predictors of potentially damaging faults, and to use this to trigger a protection circuit that will shut down the drive current for a short time and allow the diode to return to a safe state before resuming operation. The optically-triggered protection circuit combined with a constant current supply will then be tested on LDAs to demonstrate that it increases the working lifetime of off-the-shelf laser diodes."

        "Abstract": "Missile defense takes place in an unpredictable, real-time environment and thus requires an adaptive approach to optimization that dynamically allocates sensors and their supporting resources in response to changing goals and constraints. Here, we propose a system of Arbitrage Look-ahead Agents for Market-based Optimization (ALAMO) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. This negotiation mechanism and the agents\u2019 bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the multi-agent negotiation process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. Here, we extend market-based optimization using arbitrage look-ahead agents to turn this approach into a non-myopic planning algorithm, which provides both computational gains and more efficient allocation of sensor tasks."

The overall goal is to determine how to leverage advanced technologies in order to create an augmented performance environment, thereby enhancing interagency interaction in all phases of SSTR operations. In Phase I, the research necessary to design the augmented performance environment was conducted. Common cultural clashes arising during interagency SSTR planning were identified and linked to collective performance deficits. General expert strategies for handling cultural dissonance also were identified. A distributed planning environment augmented by artificial intelligence was designed in order to enable interagency players to adopt expert strategies for success and reduce incidents of collective performance deficits. A prototype version of this augmented performance environment was developed and its feasibility evaluated. Phase II effort will be devoted to extending the prototype capability to fully enable the adoption of expert strategies for success. Extended capabilities will better enable system users to set the conditions for successful interagency SSTR planning and to solve cross-cultural communication problems in real time. Phase II also will include a comprehensive test and evaluation."

Eltron Research &amp; Development Inc. (Eltron) and the Southwest Research Institute\uf0d2 (SwRI) will work together to successfully achieve this objective.  Eltron has already developed a vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process for production of high-temperature polyimide composites.  SwRI has already developed process technologies and control algorithms for Intelligent Materials Processing (IMP), which combine real-time sensor information, kinetic, and transport models with an artificial intelligence (AI) control system to optimize the cure conditions of composite processing (otherwise known as adaptive cure processing).  This partnership will combine complementary technologies that will result in the successful development of a low cost process for the production of large aerospace composite parts.  Insurance of part quality will be determined by measuring key performance metrics including mechanical, rheological, thermal, kinetic, quality, and environmental endurance properties.  During composite part production all experimental variables will be measured by Eltron and then provided to SWRI in support of their process modeling program."

        "Abstract": "The ability to identify and share information in a &quot;just enough&quot; manner is critical in defense, intelligence, and industry settings. Human analysts in both government and private sectors are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data, compounded by the increasing complexity of information sharing policies. Unlike companies that provide infrastructure and platforms for information sharing, such as guards and servers, Enkia will provide software to analyze the content of what is being shared across such platforms. Using advanced artificial intelligence technologies, Enkia will be the first to offer adaptive products that can learn to identify sensitive and critical information without extensive hand-coding of information sharing policies.  Our key insight is to leverage the same sheer volume of data that is overwhelming human analysts and use it to feed a data-hungry AI engine capable of learning from that data. Our technologies include natural language processing to analyze semantic content, case-based reasoning for document classification, and relevance feedback for automatic self-learning. This innovative combination of technologies will be deployed through a state-of-the-art service-oriented architecture, enabling usage via desktop plug-ins, server-based filters, and web service applications."

        "Abstract": "Current computer combat simulation software offers a sophisticated and high fidelity platform in terms of modeling and accurate results.  However, the development of games\/simulations that portray insurgent asymmetric warfare has lagged due to the difficulties in interpreting and managing the complexity and variety of these types of situations as well as the relative historical lack of interest in these scenarios. At the same time, however, the general world state of affairs has changed so that these types of situations are becoming more frequent that ever.  And this trend that will likely increase as information technology allows for the recruitment and control of hostile elements, and high-tech weapons become easier to acquire.   This project will address two primary areas of improvement necessary to model these actions with existing wargame software.  The first is to model the effects of the weapons and hostile forces themselves, including their command and control capabilities, tactics, ability to inflict damage from a distance, and range of improvised weapons.  The second is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) capable of both acting on behalf of a non-standard force, as well as being able to counter the actions of one in command of a conventional power."

Building on the team\u2019s expertise in real-time prognostics and health monitoring for digital electronic systems, our proposed approach will integrate state-of-the-art electronic system fault detection with higher level cognitive modeling techniques to provide the constituent capabilities for advanced, reconfigurable computing.  The self-aware system will utilize artificial intelligence technologies such as probabilistic neural networks as underlying software agents within a distributed reasoning process similar to cognitive capabilities in human thinking processes.  These systems will balance resources, efficiencies, and mission priorities to efficiently use system resources to dynamically and effectively meet changing operational requirements.  In doing so, it is anticipated that the performance of the systems can be enhanced several times when compared for such critical metrics as power consumption, fault-tolerance, and reliability."

This database is a neurologically inspired design based on data cell and link cell interactions to support new and unique advanced data analysis, new methods for entity relationship association, semantic mapping and associative search capabilities. The database is intended to support both structured and unstructured data. In response Infobionics will propose the Cellular Database design as an elegantly simpler solution for managing complex structured and unstructured data, with the ability to make data model changes as required by the application with minimal effort. It offers new possibilities for easy and more powerful searches to discover information and knowledge in more natural ways. The cellular database combines metadata and raw data in such a way as to offer the most flexible model available. This database technology is fully backward compatible with current relational databases, while supporting a new set of storage, access and search capabilities. Last, the data base can support the emerging data management capabilities based on some of the \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 and \u2018semantic network\u2019 concepts."

        "Abstract": "Military communications and weapons systems depend on the health of their components to perform reliably over extended periods of time.  Maintenance is an important aspect of reliability, assuring that equipment is on line and operational when it is needed.  The trend toward electronic\/networked maintenance documentation presents an opportunity to improve maintainer effectiveness, but new tools must be developed to manage interactions between the information sources and maintainers.  In Phase I Instrumental Sciences, Inc. (ISI), with subcontract team member Sentar, Inc., researched techniques for an Automated Multimedia Maintenance Support Tool (AMMST) based on the artificial intelligence field of cooperative multi-agent distributed work environments.  In the Phase II continuation, ISI will develop an engineering prototype AMMST, building on the successful Phase I results.  Our approach applies the multi-agent architecture to produce a distributed information management tool set to support maintenance operations.  These tools gather relevant information from diverse sources upon user request or maintenance scenario identification, then they filter the information and format it for interactive multimedia presentation to the user.  The Phase I results included a successful demonstration of a distributed information-gathering architecture, employing cooperative agents to interface with local and distant maintenance resources."

        "Abstract": "Intelligent Automation, Inc. proposes to develop an innovative tool for injury assessment that will systematically analyze and model huge amounts of experimental\/simulation data in biodynamics by exploiting established injury models and criteria currently used. Our proposed tool will be developed from synergistic combination of experimental exploitation, simulation approximation, and distributed computation. Experimental exploitation tries to utilize the experimental data to the largest extent. Exploitation of this data includes the validation of some biomechanical simulations and interpolation inside the space of experimental data\/extrapolation outside that space. Simulation approximation uses sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks to fit the experimental\/simulation datasets between the scenario inputs and injury levels under various impacts. For computational efficiency, web wide access, generation of portable systems, will use a three-tiered distributed computational architecture whereby web browsers and portable devices will perform as clients, databases and large amount of caches as web servers, and parallel computers as computational servers empowering the web servers. The envisioned end-product of this SBIR effort will be distributed, accurate and rapid injury assessment tool which utilizes experimental data, different computer simulation programs, and various injury criteria and models which offer the capability of effective decision making in the battlefield."

        "Abstract": "Management Sciences, Inc. (MSI) develops cognitive artificial intelligence tools. Cognitive reasoning is a logically constructed mathematical process that mimics the way people quickly process data into an understanding of a situation. We propose to develop a cognitive framework and toolset for processing Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) data. The architecture will have a solidly theoretical foundation with a Turing Complete Bayesian Inference Calculus for fusing data into higher and higher distillations not just collecting it. The toolset will work by using evidential fusion in combination with frames of reference to pick out important features and patterns in a track and test them against hypotheses to identify the track develop an understanding of its meaning in the context of current operations. The toolset will be used to support the work of SIGINT operators as they evaluate tracks for patterns and trends in support of the detection, identification, and tracking of potential threats."

        "Abstract": "Most of todays cross domain solutions allow only well structured text to be automatically parsed and shared at a different security levels. Unstructured text must be released by a human. While dirty words searches and classification markings are helpful, the human still needs to spend an inordinate amount of time reading the document. Often documents contain very similar text and there is no reliable method for comparing this document to what has been previously released\/denied. The user must critically re-evaluate the entire document before releasing.   The focus of this effort is reduce the amount of time the human has to spend on a document and increase the level of assurance (accuracy) in sharing information across security domains.  Our effort will focus on developing a complete approach for reducing the humans workload by: using NLP techniques to parse and tag a document, summarize (distill) the content of the unstructured data, categorize the document, use word\/phrase checking and machine learning techniques to compare to previously released documents. Provide a phase I, initial prototype, that assists the human in identifying areas of the document s\/he should focus on. A robust and complete prototype will be implemented in phase II."

        "Abstract": "In order for simulation based training to help prepare warfighters for modern asymmetric tactics, opponent models of behavior must become more dynamic and contemporary and challenge trainees with adaptive threats consistent with those increasingly encountered by the military.  The proposed Adaptive Behavior Modeling of Asymmetric Tactics (ABMAT) system will apply artificial intelligence machine learning techniques to generate adaptive adversary behaviors in a synthetic training environment.  The adaptive behaviors developed for the ABMAT system will be based on real-world example scenarios collected from subject matter experts with recent operational experience.  The action and reaction cycle that typifies recent operations against asymmetric adversaries will be captured from these scenarios and incorporated into the virtual experience base of the synthetic adversary models.  The resulting behaviors will adapt tactics in a given exercise both in response to events in the current exercise and in previous exercises, using a combination of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. This system will build on, and enhance, two commercial products: the OLIVE massively multiplayer virtual environment, and the SimBionic behavior modeling and execution tool.  The ABMAT system will be developed and validated with the OLIVE environment, but also designed for platform portability with minimal cost."

        "Abstract": "It is tremendously difficult to outfit and modernize naval vessels.  Coordinated effort is required from representatives of many different organizations, subject to frequently shifting temporal, fiscal, physical, and technological constraints.  The Navy lacks automated tools to support key acquisition decision-makers.  In particular Warfare Systems Engineering (WSEs) and Combat Systems Engineers (CSEs) need coordination and decision support in modeling, planning, and tracking projects.  Filling this need defines the vision underlying Acquisition Decision Expert Planning Technology for Systems Engineering (ADEPT-SE). Our approach to realizing ADEPT-SE draws on our extensive experience building and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools including decision-aids, planners, simulations, and knowledge management environments for military problems.  It also draws on our proven capability integrating core visualization, knowledge representation, inference, and intelligent behavior control capabilities in web-based environments to support distributed work. In this Phase II project, we propose to (1) iteratively refine requirements and designs to drive construction of successively more capable ADEPT-SE prototypes, (2) evaluate releases of the prototype through feature testing, user evaluations, and finally pilot testing, (3) develop an appropriate technology transition plan that leads to introduction of novel and useful new capability into the Naval acquisition process.  The ultimate ADEPT-SE system will provide an innovative mix of multi-user collaboration and expert-system decision-support capabilities for modeling, planning, and tracking ship systems acquisition in an easily useable and available web-based format."

        "Abstract": "The Intelligent Surface Threat Identification System (ISTIS) is based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.  ISTIS will automatically analyze the data associated with a track, hypothesize, draw inferences, and make ID related recommendations.  These data include the tracks\u2019 location and\/or velocity reported over time and other ID related reports such as IFF codes, visual ID reports, acoustic signature, specific emitter ID (SEI), ELINT signature, FLIR reports, intelligence reports, communications, etc. The ultimate goal of this effort is to improve the ID process, quality, and efficiency.  This improved performance includes better use of scarce ID resources, better ID estimations from available information, sooner ID determinations, prevention of ID \u201csurprises\u201d, and operating successfully in more complex environments.  ISTIS will demonstrate a significant potential for improved ID performance and reduced LCS ID manning in Phase II.  Other LCS applications and other ship types will also benefit from the techniques.  In Phase II, ISTIS will be integrated with the LCS C&amp;D suite at Lockheed Martin\u2019s Technology Collaboration Center (TCC)."

This algorithm will allow a network agent to determine what information is of most value to client agents onboard aircraft based on tactical objectives and the current battlefield situation. Our approach is to use Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) \u2013 a leading technique in the field of artificial intelligence \u2013 as a data structure to model the current information content of each agent in the network and determine the appropriate level of detail to transmit. As new data is received by an agent in the network, the resulting improvement in mission-specific knowledge is quantified through measures from information theory. If the change is significant, the network agent transmits the information to appropriate agents in the network. In Phase I, we will develop appropriate DBNs for representative naval missions, develop a software prototype, and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and algorithms. In Phase II, we will refine the scheme and develop a more sophisticated prototype that would allow us to demonstrate and evaluate the scheme."

This will be accomplished through the analysis of selected missions, first defining the specific decisions that must be made to accomplish the missions and then identifying the tasks, data and information required to make the decisions. Based on this analysis a scalable functional design will be developed and technologies such as artificial intelligence identified to implement specific functions within the design. Special attention will be given to human system integration. Finally, a combat system of the future data fusion prototype will be developed and tested with both simulated and at sea data (if available) to evaluate the performance improvement afforded by the new technology."

        "Abstract": "The technical objective of this proposal is to design a flexible and efficient wirelss, ad-hoc, sensor network architecture that is tuned for monitoring chemical and biological threats.  This requires that the architecture 1) support various types of chemical and biological micro-sensors in a heterogeneous sensor network,  2) enable \u201csmart\u201d sensor nodes  to pre-process on-board the enormous amount of data they collect, 3) facilitate collaborative communication and routing between sensor nodes, in a loosely dispersed and irregular grid, and  4) wirelessly transmit their data to a central station, in real-time or near real-time.  To achieve flexibility, the concept of layers will be used to define the network level and sensor level.  To achieve smart decision making capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI)-based software agents will be defined.  To achieve auto-configuration, collaboration and real-time data transmission, ad-hoc mesh networking techniques will be employed.  A limited demonstration will be conducted to illustrate the feasibility of the wireless sensor network and proposed architecture.  Commercial RF components will be used to demonstrate the real-time communications, on-board processing, wireless data transmission and mesh networking capabilities of the network.  Currently available and prototype chemical sensors will be deployed with RF devices into the network to demonstrate the feasibility of their integration and operation in the network.  The sensors will include a nanoparticle, array-based sensor for vapor detection (developed the Next Dimensions Technologies and the California Institute of Technology for DHS). An electrochemical ethylene monitor (developed by Giner, Inc. for NASA) will be combined and demonstrated as part of the Multi-Sensor Data Fusion in the option task."

        "Abstract": "Military communications and weapons systems depend on the health of their components to perform reliably over extended periods of time.  Maintenance is an important aspect of reliability, assuring that the equipment is on line and operational when it is needed.  Military-developed and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment now co-exist in complex military systems. The trend toward electronic\/networked maintenance documentation presents an opportunity to improve maintainer effectiveness, but new tools must be developed to manage interactions between the information sources and maintainers.  Instrumental Sciences, Inc. (ISI) proposes an Automated Multimedia Maintenance Support Tool (AMMST) based on the artificial intelligence field of cooperative multi-agent distributed work environments.  Our approach combines the multi-agent architecture with statistical analysis and maintenance decision-making technology that ISI has developed for Predictive Fault Detection applications to produce a distributed information management tool set that gathers relevant information from diverse sources upon user request or maintenance scenario identification, combines and filters the information, then formats it for multimedia interactive presentation to the user.  The primary objectives of the Phase I research are to (1) determine the feasibility of the AMMST concept and (2) characterize the potential of the tool to reduce downtime, and thus to improve system availability."

        "Abstract": "The rate at which ISR assets can currently disseminate data and be re-tasked to evaluate new threats is limited by the stove-piped nature of existing ISR systems and their inability to operate with other data distribution systems. This lack of interoperability can lead to delays in the prosecution of a target. By contrast, a Service Oriented Architecture that could be successfully integrated with legacy ISR systems, and that could be extensible and adaptable for future expansion and connection with the Global information Grid, would provide the means for rapid, real-time dissemination of intelligence to warfighters. Couple this faster information dissemination with artificial intelligence that can dynamically allocate ISR resources, and the result can  provide warfighters with the information to make critical decisions in substantially less time, saving lives in the process. There are technical challenges to be met, and Lakota will apply the experience gained from its involvement in similar efforts to determine the feasibility and identify the risks in applying this approach to ISR Sensor system networking.BENEFITS: The implementation of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) will enable ISR assets to be dynamically allocated and controlled through the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. It will also allow interoperation among the myriad of heterogeneous legacy, existing, and anticipated Joint Force standards. The dynamic nature of SOA creates a loose coupling of discrete software components and will give the Navy a competitive advantage over its adversaries by dramatically reducing the time between target acquisition and target destruction."

        "Abstract": "MaXentric\u2019s NAVAIR Embedded Assessment System (NEAS) offers a command and control methodology for embedded sensors. NEAS is designed to operate in challenging scenarios, such as weapons effect damage assessment of hard and deeply buried targets. NEAS corrects for deficiencies that are inherent with embedded sensory systems, such as limited communication links, low computational power, small processor memory sizes, noisy sensors, and sensor failure. NEAS enables advanced methods of exploiting embedded sensor networks through two innovations: a novel embedded processing architecture, and an artificial intelligence approach to network behavior. These two features enable dynamic command and control of event reporting, data filtering, collaboration, and data fusion. Phase I efforts focus on evaluation of the feasibility of the sensor network formation, its operation and viability of the sensor data collection, and its data exploitation methodology. BENEFITS: MaXentric\u2019s NAVAIR Embedded Assessment System (NEAS) lays a dependable foundation for effective deployment and operation of embedded sensors, and is thus well positioned to capitalize on this critical demand from both government and commercial markets. Embedded sensors are envisioned to be the \u201ceyes\u201d and \u201cears\u201d of a modernized U.S. military. MaXentric\u2019s NEAS enables U.S. forces to use embedded sensors to increase precision, lethality, and efficiency. Some prime examples are battle damage assessment, combat power estimation, and portside security.  In the long term, embedded networked sensing systems will be found almost everywhere, from the car to the hospital operating room and to the home. MaXentric\u2019s NEAS Command and Control interface for these \u201csmart\u201d embedded sensor networks will enable revolutionary technologies, including Mass Transit Automation, Autonomous Building Management, and Smart Cars."

        "Abstract": "The proposed system will be capable of providing diagnostic and prognostic nonlinear structural analysis for gas turbine engine metallic components and component assemblies.  This approach will use vibration testing and analysis techniques that have proven to be successful for determining turbomachinery structural health, and tie them together with a software program utilizing \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d.  Vibration data will be recorded with sensors in key locations during engine operation.  This data will be analyzed by an autonomous software program using curve fitting of natural frequency peaks, interference diagrams, a detailed finite element model, and comparisons to previously recorded vibration signatures.  When a shift in a natural frequency is detected by the on-board sensors, a simulated crack is introduced into the FEA model and its size and location are adjusted until the analytical vibration predictions match the measured data.  The efficiency of this process is increased significantly by the use and understanding of an interference diagram, as the location and size of a crack can be deduced by knowing the specific modes that have been influenced.  The results of the finite element model will provide the crack size and location information needed for detailed fracture mechanics calculations and predictions for remaining component life."

        "Abstract": "Modernizing naval vessels is a tremendously complex task, requiring coordinated effort by representatives of many different organizations, and subject to frequently shifting temporal, fiscal, physical, and technological constraints.  The Navy lacks automated tools to support key modernization decision-makers.  In particular, Participating Managers (PARMs) need coordination and decision support in modeling, planning, and tracking projects.  Filling this need defines the vision underlying Acquisition Decision Expert Planning Technology for Modernization (ADEPT-M). Our approach to realizing ADEPT-M draws on our extensive experience building and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools including decision-aids, planners, simulations, and knowledge management environments for military problems.  It also draws on our proven capability integrating core visualization, knowledge representation, inference, and intelligent behavior control capabilities in web-based environments to support distributed work. In this Phase I project, we propose to (1) identify the requirements for an effective ADEPT-M system, (2) define an appropriate overarching technology architecture responsive to those requirements, (3) develop a corresponding software system design and build plan, and (4) produce a limited proof-of-concept demonstration with supporting documentation.  The ultimate ADEPT-M system will provide an innovative mix of collaboration and expert-system decision-support capabilities for modeling, planning, and tracking ship modernization in an easily useable and available web-based format."

        "Abstract": "Present submarine combat operations place tremendous stress on operators, coordinators, and commanding officers in assimilating and filtering acoustic and non acoustic sensor, weapon, intelligence and environmental data necessary to carry out assigned missions.  The result often leads to errors or long time delays increasing own ship vulnerability and limiting mission success. The planned introduction of advanced sensors, weapons and communications to counter the advanced threat will further aggravate the existing combat system information management problems. A new advanced combat system design is proposed that must provide improved information management capabilities to maintain tactical control in all scenarios including high contact density environments and optimally employ improved sensors, weapons, vehicles, and tactics needed to counter advanced threats.  Each function within the new future combat system will be fully defined in terms of expected input data types, quality and rates and required output data that will be used in other functions. Physical models will also be described for each of the new functions. Each function will be explored to determine the feasibility of using artificial intelligence or heuristic inference rule sets (knowledge base) or numerical algorithms to increase automation with the goal of reduced manning."

        "Abstract": "The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a decision aid tool that provides for the management and arbitration of data flow between fielded assets. Our solution will act as a decision aid to support situational awareness on the battlefield. Assets can be coordinated efficiently since decision-makers and dismounted units alike will have access to the full situational picture. Our solution will assure interoperability between assets such as multiple field-based robotic platforms and robotic controllers by: 1) Creating the software translators between several fielded data formats including Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS), Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF), and High Level Architecture (HLA) to enable interoperation of tactical elements, and 2) Integrating an Intelligent Agent framework to enable a variety of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g. Bayesian Belief Networks, Constraint Propagation Programming, expert systems) to aid in data management and display tasks. Results of the Phase II effort will be a demonstration system consisting of several robotic platforms whose sensor data is transmitted to a tool called the Tactical Data Aggregator (TDA), which will provide the Common Operations Picture (COP), and be compatible with the Global Information Grid via System of Systems Common Operating Environment (SOSCOE) interfaces."

        "Abstract": "Applied Visions, Inc.(AVI) proposes to leverage  the technology of computer games to provide a powerful new method of predicting and visualizing the potential movement of time critical moving targets for operators of the FCS and FFW networked effects nodes. Our research will build upon the results of a similar SBIR project sponsored by the Navy for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). That effort, currently entering Phase II, uses agent-based artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the likely destinations and paths of the targets, combined with sophisticated vehicle mobility modeling to calculate the probable locations of the vehicle at any given future time as they move towards those destinations. Our Phase I effort will be devoted to analyzing the requirements of the Army&apos;s FCS fires and effects systems and use those requirements to design and build an early prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Our Phase II effort will refine the architecture; upgrade the prototype to interface to a fire support system such as AFATDS, then field the prototype to participate in exercises and technology demonstrations."

        "Abstract": "Protecting national security software against unauthorized distribution and exploitation is necessary for the protection of intellectual property (IP) and secrets in our nation.  Modern software attack and analysis tools have become, along with their users, more skilled at analyzing and modifying programs.  Currently, technologies that protect, detect, and react (PDR) to the exploitation of binary executables are inserted in a manual or semi-automated fashion.  This method of insertion, especially manual insertion, is labor intensive, time-consuming, and subject to human error.  This proposal describes a method for utilizing current PDR insertion and measurement technologies which can be used to build an automated tool that quickly and securely generates binary executable protections that fit within given performance and size constraints.  The approach described is unique in that it uses artificial intelligence to evolve optimal protections.  Such an approach could pave the way for future software security standards."

        "Abstract": "Missile defense takes place in an unpredictable, real-time environment and thus requires an adaptive approach to optimization that dynamically allocates sensors and their supporting resources in response to changing goals and constraints. Here, we propose a system for Sensor Network Optimization using Multi-Agent Negotiation (SNOMAN) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. The negotiation mechanism and bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the multi-agent negotiation process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. Negotiation works continuously, providing dynamic adaptation to changes in the mission environment. Negotiation also minimizes communication resource requirements, ensuring that the system scales well to more complex sensor networks."

        "Abstract": "The Army has engaged in a modeling and simulation effort to develop advanced technologies and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) supporting the transformation to the network-centric warfare (NCW) concept. These activities have culminated in the Modeling Architecture for Technology, Research, and Experimentation (MATREX), a fully distributed and service-based architecture encouraging the &quot;plug-and-play&quot; of individual models. Within the MATREX, the Command, Control, and Communications Grid (C3Grid) models operator behaviors using a behavior engine based on the Java Expert System Shell (JESS), and has been deemed insufficient to effectively model the expanding range of behaviors, due to its brittleness and lack of maintainability. We propose to develop an enhanced behavior engine for the MATREX by applying an overarching software architecture (based on our existing SAMPLE architecture) allowing for the integration of a range of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (fuzzy logic, Bayesian reasoning, genetic algorithms, etc.) to model decision-making more robustly and efficiently, with specific focus on enhanced usability. The SAMPLE-based Model of Intelligent Task performance by Human operators (SMITH) will be integrated into the MATREX with specific focus on its interactions with the C3Grid&apos;s C3 human performance model (C3HPM), providing an effective representation of both decision-making behavior and task performance."

The architecture will combine the best aspects of different architectures, including Wireless Sensor Networks, Mobile Multi Agent strategies, Service Orientated Architectures, Artificial Intelligence and Multi Sensor Data Fusion techniques to accomplish a modular, flexibility and efficient platform that can deploy a wide range of sensor monitoring applications.   In parallel with the architectural design, we will design and specify a prototype application.  This dual approach will promote the solid design of a architecture that assimilates the needs of applications into the core of its framework.  The prototype application will incorporate three sensors that Erallo has worked with previously, including a wireless transdermal alcohol sensor, heart rate monitor and accelerometer. Erallo also proposes to conduct a limited clinical trial at the end of Phase I using the 3 sensor devices to demonstration the feasibility and operations of a wireless sensor network system with automatic daily data transmission. The trial will collect data that can be used in the knowledge base for the PTSD application being designed in Phase I and planned for trial in Phase II."

To provide the real-time response to environmental changes, the GBL Team ECDSS will link proven Artificial Intelligence Technology reasoning `Agents&apos; into a unified system that utilizes expert knowledge in specific domains to augment crew efficiency and involvement in the ForceNet. The ECDSS will enable a single operator to manage and generate jamming assignments and exploit the ability to share response coverage between on and off-board assets. The ECDSS will coordinate mission goals by performing critical timing of asset utilization to exploit jamming techniques that are unworkable without the use of Intelligent agents.

The objective of this research project is to deliver an adaptive AI-based simulation technology with predictive capabilities that will enable a family of operational-level tools and simulations that can propose and assess realistic and emergent adversarial behavior, automate the creation and examination of potential friendly and adversary courses of action (COAs), help reduce the risks of cascading effects, and support planners in anticipating, planning for, and combating threats using the full range of new conflict-winning capabilities including advanced weapons systems (AWS) such as directed energy weapons (DEW).    The effort will involve the RI partner, JPL\/NASA\/Caltech conducting a series of verification and validation (V&amp;V) tests of the Cyberwar XXI adaptive AI technology (implemented during Phase I in a playable Iraq War simulation scenario), with Hexagon conducting additional research and development based on feedback and data from each of the V&amp;V rounds resulting in a higher confidence AI technology and a more accurate simulation of the Iraq War."

        "Abstract": "Impact Technologies, in collaboration with Honeywell Inc., proposes to develop and demonstrate improved on-board embedded diagnostics for avionics as well as open communications architectures that enable information continuity between on-board and off-board systems or maintenance aids. Within this paradigm shift approach, embedded diagnostics improvements will be sought through the evaluation of improved sensed features, various artificial intelligence methods, and more detailed consideration of available data, both embedded and from a data bus monitor. The application of avionics reliability and aging (usage) models to improve assessments or resolve ambiguity will also be addressed. In addition, an ambiguity group analysis that employs data fusion will be developed to assist the at-wing, automated test equipment, if necessary, to rank probable causes. Complementary prognostic techniques including analysis of projected operating conditions by physics-based component aging models, empirical (trending) models, and system level failure progression models will be used to develop verifiable prognostic models. The proposed approach, diagnostic techniques, and prognostic models will be demonstrated during the Phase I. The utilization of all of these sources of engineering information can provide up-to-date assessments and predictions of remaining useful life for use in automated logistics systems."

        "Abstract": "Building cognitive systems that can interact with real world environments encompasses fields ranging from cognitive science, research artificial intelligence, robotics and control and many other research areas.   While significant advances have been made in all of these arenas, the integration of these capabilities into functional cognitive systems remains a significant challenge. Our approach is premised upon a number of observations and principles.  We observe that a general, unified theory of cognition has proven elusive.  Moreover, existing monolithic system development approaches cannot efficiently implement and integrate the full spectrum of cognitive knowledge representation and algorithms, nor can they take advantage of novel computer architectures and capabilities. In the proposed Phase II effort, we will develop an end-to-end framework, methodology and supporting tools for cognitive systems development.  The system-oriented development approach does not focus exclusively on single theories of cognition.  Rather, it addresses the design and specification of components and the integration and optimization of components into coherent cognitive systems.  It will include functional and behavioral components, control frameworks, and support tools and runtime infrastructures.  The goal of this effort is to make the approach sufficiently complete and usable so that it can be used in research into cognitive architectures and systems."

        "Abstract": "For early detection and monitoring of failure precursors in mechanical transmission couplings, we propose to develop signal processing capabilities that can map patterns in accelerometer data to an anomaly measure. Toward this end, Professor Asok Ray at Penn-State University has pioneered an elaborate mathematical theory based on symbolic time series analysis (STSA), statistical mechanics, and information theory.  An anomaly detection algorithm is formulated by applying this novel STSA theory to create a robust statistical pattern recognition technique. For anomaly detection, this STSA technique has been shown to be superior to conventional pattern recognition techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and principal component analysis (PCA) because it exploits a common physical fact underling most anomalies which conventional techniques do not. This superiority has recently been demonstrated on electrical circuits, fatigue testing machines, and mechanical components undergoing fatigue due to vibrations. The research objectives are: (i) to develop a coupling model where gradually evolving damage phenomena can be introduced, (ii) to formulate and compare real-time algorithms for early detection and monitoring of failure precursors in model simulations based on three principal techniques and their variants - STSA, ANN, and PCA, and (iii) to demonstrate these algorithms on fatigue damage accumulating parts of a vibrating machine experiment."

        "Abstract": "In the phase 1 effort, IAI and its subcontractor, Prof. Jose B. Cruz of the Ohio State University (OSU), have proposed to systemically explore differential pursuit-evasion games with multiple pursuers and evaders. Our Phase I results have shown the theoretical possibility of rigorous formulation, analysis and solutions for stochastic differential Pursuit-evasion games involving multiple pursuers and evaders. The systematic approach enables us to connect this novel approach to the existing theories in pursuit-evasion games and general dynamic games. Up to now, step by step we have extended the existing theory on deterministic PE games with single purser and single evader to more a general game problem involving multiple players under uncertainty. However, in each step the problem can be further investigated in more theoretical depth. On the other hand, it is clear that stochastic pursuit-evasion game problem spans a wide range covering various fields in optimal control, dynamic game, filtering, tracking, artificial intelligence and cooperative control.  Our Primary Phase II objective is to synthesize the newly proposed multiple players stochastic game theorems with the existing theories to create an efficient computational package for practical problems."

This tool will enhance the ABDR team&apos;s ability to evaluate battle damage and develop  feasible repair options and procedures, especially during war-time.  It could also serve as a valuable tool for training.   The proposed system will enhance existing ABDR support tools, and provide the ABDR sustainment community an intelligent simulator for analysis. Artificial intelligence and data mining techniques will be employed to mine knowledge from historic data repositories. Structural and dynamic load factors will also be considered. The underlying model will be based on heuristic and probabilistic theories. Historic data will be used to test, verify, and validate the model. This prototype system will also identify application infrastructure delivery issues including deployment communications, and system availability. Phase I will produce a limited prototype system to demonstrate the proof of concept. A more robust prototype will be delivered in Phase II."

The intelligent agents module is configurable and customizable to create specialized intelligent agents to accomplish their tasks, as a key component in the NIADDA.  The NIADDA capabilities can be used via both Web Services and API.  In Phase I POC will demonstrate functionality and reusability through simulation and performance assessment.  The innovative NIADDA applications will provide the basis for developing next generation intelligent agents for network centric fires, to support application component development in Phase II.  In Phase II we will develop detailed component design and component API specifications, implement software and application scenarios, and provide complete documentation of the NIADDA techniques, analyses, and demonstration results."

It is well known that while these approaches are excellent for certain applications, they have thus far proven less then satisfactory for thorough understanding the interactions of enzyme-inhibitor systems when used in Ki or IC50 prediction and best pose selection.  To address this issue, in the first part of the proposed research, we will utilize our linear scaling, quantum mechanics algorithm and collaborate with our industrial partners to further research, develop, and validate a quantum mechanics-based score function, called QMScore, capable of predicting Ki and binding modes to the levels of accuracy required by the in silico drug discovery world.  In the second part of the project, we utilize a knowledge management and artificial intelligence platform to aide in the usability of this advanced methodology by researching the relationships between structure and QM convergence - the ultimate goal being the development of an intelligent and adaptive system for drug discovery."

An intelligent data filtering tool will provide improved data access, integration, storage and control for space-based sensors across C2 systems. The tool will test a variety of algorithms for their effectiveness and efficiency in tuning filters and reducing network traffic across sensors. The algorithms tested will include neural networks, genetic algorithms, and clustering algorithms such as K-means and Kohonen&apos;s Self Organizing Map. The search tool will be based on RAM Laboratories&apos; WarpIV kernel, which will link our search tool with real-time databases via the communications infrastructure, and run efficiently via parallel and distributed processing. Specifically, this Phase I effort will (1) demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an intelligent data filtering tool for space-based sensors, (2) research and develop a variety of artificial intelligence algorithms to conduct filtering, and (3) develop a physical proof-of-concept prototype that will improve data access, integration, storage and control for space based-sensors across C2 systems."

        "Abstract": "We propose to build for the Air Force a next-generation adversary model that can dynamically generate realistic adversary behavior in an operational-level air campaign simulation.  This system will use advanced artificial intelligence behavior modeling techniques to capture a broad range of potential adversary actions and decisions, including the effects of culture and other extra-cognitive factors on behavior.  The proposed system consists of two components:  an adversary authoring tool and a model execution engine.  The authoring tool will permit military analysts to customize all aspects of the adversary model without the assistance of a programmer.  This tool will feature an intuitive visual editor in which the user can assemble models from basic building blocks by manipulating graphical elements.  Giving analysts direct control over the adversary models will encourage the development of better models. The model execution engine will use the resulting models to control adversary forces in a simulation.  The engine will include an execution monitor allowing the analyst to observe the changing &quot;mental state&quot; of the adversary as well as to ask for an explanation of any action or decision. The proposed system will, by enabling more realistic adversary responses to blue actions, improve simulation-based course of action assessment."

We propose, ultimately, the development of an Intelligent FCS Fires Management System (IFFMS), integrated with the FCS System-of-systems Common Operating Environment (SoSCOE) which monitors the position and status of net centric fires related weapon systems and sensors and  the position and status of observed enemy units and assets, receives existing plans and requests for fire support and fire missions, generates fire plans (including routes) to best meet the requests, and performs the necessary fires integration, coordination, and deconfliction.    In Phase I we will explore the net centric fires and effects planning, coordination, integration, and deconfliction process with current operational experts and those familiar with FCS, elaborate the artificial intelligence techniques useful for automating the planning\/resource selection\/scheduling\/conflict resolution process, capture the planning, coordination, integration, and deconfliction knowledge needed to generate optimized, correct plans, investigate FCS SoSCOE integration requirements, prove the feasibility of these techniques through prototype development, and develop the Phase II system specification for IFFMS."

        "Abstract": "Stottler Henke proposes a software system, the Intelligent Surface Threat Identification System (ISTIS), based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and our previous work, an existing Navy ID system, the Intelligent Identification Software Module (IISM).  ISTIS will automatically analyze the data associated with a track, hypothesize, draw inferences, and make ID related recommendations.  These data include the tracks&apos; location and\/or velocity reported over time and other ID related reports such as IFF codes, visual ID reports, acoustic signature, specific emitter ID (SEI), ELINT signature, FLIR reports, intelligence reports, communications, etc. The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve the quality and efficiency of the ID process.  This improved performance includes better use of scarce ID resources, better ID estimations from available information, sooner ID determinations, prevention of ID &quot;surprises&quot;, and operating successfully in more complex environments.  The goals of the Phase I research are to understand the current and potential ID environment, especially in littoral areas of interest to the US Navy; elaborate the heuristics, algorithms and techniques for automatic ID analysis; prove the feasibility of the techniques through prototype development; and develop the Phase II system design."

        "Abstract": "Scheduling of medical appointments across the military enterprise presents a number of problems. Studies done of the responsiveness of numerous Military Treatment Facilities have highlighted the need for improvements in the scheduling process. In response to these findings, the Department of Defense has set ambitious targets for improvements in patient responsiveness, such as minimal waiting times for intake, and minimal times from appointment request to appointment date, and the ability to do same day appointments for ancillary laboratory visits.    The ability to deliver on these service commitments will hinge upon being able to not only do optimal (with respect to service commitments) scheduling amongst the units of a single MTF, but amongst facilities that are geographically dispersed. It will require the integration of appropriate patient information and integration with other existing infrastructure that facilitate the patient&apos;s ability to determine appointment times based upon their preferences. It will require interfaces that allow providers to enter appropriate business logic for their unit in natural ways, as well as facilitate the use of advance scheduling algorithms that can effectively information about resource requirements and availabilities, staff availabilities, and coverage constraints to fast appointment and resource planning.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence point to a number of approaches to scheduling that could yield significant improvements in the patient experience, if applied. We propose to investigate such approaches using our Aurora scheduling system as a core technology. We will extend this system to allow for integration with existing DOD healthcare infrastructure."

The concept has been partially extracted from other real world development tools that are thought to provide meaningful analogy and focus for portions of the envisioned process.

        "Abstract": "To meet the demand for more &quot;intelligent&quot; applications-in web services, enterprise software, network management, etc.-developers are turning to the AI technique of rule-based programming. But the very things that make rule-based programming attractive-its flexibility, its introduction of complex and dynamically changing control structures-raise serious security concerns.    ATC-NY, in collaboration with Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC), will develop SPRINT, a tool to support secure programming in the rule-based language CLIPS.  SPRINT can be thought of as a sophisticated type-checker for a modest extension of CLIPS.  The extensions, which take the form of structured comments, provide a way for programmers to indicate more precise constraints on intended execution, and thereby provide &quot;checkable hints&quot; to SPRINT.  A program that passes SPRINT type checks will have eliminated many potential security flaws.  Since CLIPS is broadly similar to many other rule-based languages, we expect that the techniques and principles developed in this work will be generally applicable."

        "Abstract": "Missile defense takes place in an unpredictable, real-time environment and thus requires an adaptive approach to optimization that dynamically allocates sensors and their supporting resources in response to changing goals and constraints. Here, we propose a system for Sensor Network Optimization using Multi-Agent Negotiation (SNOMAN) to meet the challenge of this real-time resource allocation problem. This approach applies solutions from economic theory, particularly game theory, to the resource allocation problem by creating an artificial market for sensor information and computational resources. Intelligent agents are the buyers and sellers in this market, and they represent all the elements of the sensor network, from sensors to sensor platforms to computational resources. These agents interact based on a negotiation mechanism that determines their bidding strategies. The negotiation mechanism and bidding strategies are based on game theory, and they are designed so that the aggregate result of the multi-agent negotiation process is a market in competitive equilibrium, which guarantees an optimal allocation of resources throughout the sensor network. Negotiation works continuously, providing dynamic adaptation to changes in the mission environment. Negotiation also minimizes communication resource requirements, ensuring that the system scales well to more complex sensor networks."

        "Abstract": "Through this project, Coverity will demonstrate the effectiveness of automated source code analyses in improving the security and reliability of critical software.   Coverity will develop and apply source code analysis checks that will automatically detect common causes of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, as well as application-specific security problems in various critical code bases.  Coverity will also detect other types of software defects, including memory and resource leaks, which affect overall reliability.     Although the idea of source code analysis is not new, the tools that have come to market are prohibitively difficult to use or fail to scale to the size of commercial applications.  Coverity&apos;s solutions successfully overcome these barriers with novel, state-of-the-art technology.  The prototype for Coverity&apos;s patent-pending source code analysis technology was originally developed by a team of researchers in the Computer Systems Lab at Stanford University.  Initial applications of this technology in the research setting resulted in the successful detection of over 2000 defects and hundreds of exploitable security holes in the Linux and OpenBSD operating systems.  Coverity&apos;s current analysis engine uses interprocedural data-flow analyses coupled with sophisticated abstraction techniques that may be used to uncover a wide range of software defects including    \u00b7 Security holes  \u00b7 Buffer overruns  \u00b7 Memory corruption  \u00b7 Memory\/Resource leaks  \u00b7 Deadlocks and race conditions  \u00b7 API misuse  \u00b7 Violations of coding standards    Unlike other tools that have surfaced over the years, Coverity&apos;s solution scales to millions of lines of code, achieves 100% path coverage, and requires no manual modifications or testing.  Coverity&apos;s technology can pinpoint hundreds to thousands of critical defects out of the box with orders of magnitude less noise than other source code analysis tools.    A unique feature of Coverity&apos;s tool is its extensibility.  Company specific rules, custom security policies, or errors detected by QA can be easily turned into checks that can be plugged into the analysis platform.  Furthermore, statistical learning and data mining techniques can be used to automatically retarget the tool to different code bases with differing coding conventions, styles and idioms."

        "Abstract": "Traditional methods for constructing knowledge-intensive systems have relied heavily on intervention from artificial intelligence specialists.  The first step in this intervention is typically either: extensive human-directed interviews of subject-matter experts so that the knowledge can then be laboriously hand-encoded; or the training of SMEs in some highly-restricted intermediate representation.  Such systems have been costly to produce, and have typically failed to model expert knowledge to any degree of complexity outside of very narrow domains.  This failure has been a major obstacle to the development of systems that harness human reasoning with a computer&apos;s tireless attention to detail.  We propose to investigate why knowledge engineers need to be in the loop, and provide requirements and high-level design to addresses many of these problems.  Our focus will be on interfaces that operate in the SME&apos;s domain of discourse.  As a concrete example, we will be looking at a mixed graphical\/textual representation of the intelligence analysis process whereby complex rules can be expressed as simple questions in a context inherited from the workflow.  Our experimentation to date has found that this representation is not only very intuitive for SMEs, but is also highly productive in comparison to more conventional rule-construction methods."

        "Abstract": "The CAMS\/GO-81 databases contain massive amounts of historical maintenance data that is unusable in the present form. The primary barrier to effectively using this data for troubleshooting purposes is the &quot;free form&quot; nature of the text fields that describe discrepancies and corrective actions. These text fields contain a wide array of &quot;noisy&quot; data and artifacts that prevent the effective query and search of the database without pre-processing and filtering of the data. The proposed approach seeks to develop a system that functions as a middleware application and enables the maintainer to retrieve useful legacy data in a format that is most useful for the maintenance environment. By using a data mining approach that is a hybrid collection of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques along with concepts from the field of natural language processing (NLP) it is possible to extract useful information from CAMS\/GO-81. A combined hybrid approach is proposed since no single technique alone will provide the functionality that is necessary. The proposed approach will enable the Air Force to leverage this legacy data and to deploy a system that will evolve in strength as the system &quot;learns&quot; from the maintainers cognitive processes."

        "Abstract": "The main objective of this proposal is to provide a modeling, assimilation, forecasting, and data analysis platform to support the Communication \/ Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C\/NOFS) mission of the AFRL.  The system will combine several components developed by Fusion Numerics Inc. along with new specialized modules.   The goal of the C\/NOFS mission is to understand the physics of the ionosphere in equatorial regions and to forecast accurately the subsequent scintillation-producing irregularities. To meet this goal, we propose a system based on the synthesis of several unique techniques developed during prior SBIR funded projects: (1) an artificial intelligence algorithm known as Support Vector Machine for predicting changes in solar wind from solar images; (2) an empirical model of electric field potentials; (3) a physics-based assimilative ionospheric model for forecasting ionospheric dynamics; and (4) a model and forecast uncertainty evolution scheme based on ensemble Kalman filter.  Additionally, we propose a novel infrastructure for a modular unified forecast system.  Such an infrastructure will allow practitioners to easily replace models of ionospheric components as they become available.  The infrastructure will rely on ESML (Earth Science Markup Language) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) based web-services for model interfacing, data stream integration and data distribution."

        "Abstract": "The main objective of this project is to develop an efficient stochastic-optimization approach that can be applied to large-scale high-complexity Army military vehicle applications in a high-speed distributed computer hardware environment. Specifically, the proposed work will integrate the refined stochastic response models (stochastic field expansion approximations) developed by GP Technologies Inc. with the RBDO Probabilistic Measure Approach (PMA) developed by the University of Iowa. The research project team will explore and refine the stochastic response analysis part of the UOI RBDO approach based on state-of-the-art stochastic field\/network modeling and artificial intelligence concepts. The proposed development will also include fast Dynamic Monte Carlo simulation algorithms, plus Bayesian inference for optimal model fitting and selection. Phase I will also provide a probabilistic-design methodology for incorporating the data and modeling uncertainties in the RBDO problem and will explore the application of other non-deterministic approaches to RBDO including multi-objective problems. In Phase I the proposed RBDO methodology will be applied to the Army M1A1 tank road arm component via ANSYS FEA code. The RBDO approach will operate in the distributed environment of hardware available at the U.S. Army. The parallel programming task will be conceptually initiated in Phase I and completed in Phase II."

        "Abstract": "Toolkits for Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly being used in government and industry.  If such systems have access to sensitive information, it is important to know their security properties.  A toolkit may contain low-level flaws, such as buffer-overrun errors that allow an attacker to gain control of the host system.  Or, there may be flaws in the rule base of a system implemented with the toolkit that allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.  We propose the detailed study of the security properties of CLIPS, a widely used expert-system shell in two parts.  The first part will be a detailed analysis of the source code of the system using static analysis tools and other methods to find low-level flaws.  The second part will be a study of the CLIPS language and the exploration of static and dynamic approaches to create secure CLIPS programs.   A promising approach is to model the CLIPS system as a weighted push down system, and to use model-checking techniques to implement a range of security analyses, including termination analysis and information flow.  The results will include a design for a tool to be prototyped in Phase II, and guidelines on how to write a secure CLIPS specification."

        "Abstract": "Computer wargames and combat simulation software has reached a very high level of comprehensiveness and sophistication in terms of modeling fidelity and accurate results.  The recently released simulation titled Point of Attack-2, in particular, affords users a very powerful combat simulation package in a desktop PC environment.  At the same time, however, the increased complexity of the system makes a reasonably competent and challenging AI more important than ever, principally because the complexity makes operating the game much more difficult for human players.  Thus, in order for the program to be accessible, let alone entertaining and enjoyable, the AI must be capable of &quot;assisting&quot; the player in a wide range of situations.    Competent AI additionally serves the function of making the game more realistic by taking control away from players in certain appropriate situations and having units act reasonably  (as when units run or take cover, or retreat without explicit orders), and also providing users of the software with an effective training and learning tool.  By being able to act like a live human opponent would, players can see the results or their actions and strategies in a much more realistic &quot;real-world&quot; environment, without the time, resources, or personnel required for a multi-human player situation."

We shall investigate Demand Management Systems to continuously monitor sources and demands and mitigate the severity of cascading electrical system casualties by enacting priority load-shedding.  Perhaps most innovatively, we shall investigate the potential energy savings to be obtained through the implementation of Intelligent Agents, a network of discrete digital sensor\/actuators which constitute a distributed artificial intelligence capability, in their capacity to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of a single distributed ship system.    We intend to apply for the SBIR Fast Track. In the Phase I Option effort, we shall investigate the potential energy savings from implementing high-efficiency motors, high-efficiency lighting, and extending the Intelligent Agent technology to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of the system of systems which make up a modern warship."

        "Abstract": "Existing turn-based strategy war games have the potential to act as useful military training tools.  However, their utility is greatly limited by the shortfalls of the artificial intelligence (AI) routines used to provide computer opponents. The key limitation in state-of the-art AI used in commercial wargames is the inability of the computer to perform situation assessment - to recognize the human player&apos;s tactics and strategy. Information Extraction and Transport, Inc. (IET) will develop a sophisticated architecture for automated situation assessment as part of a powerful and adaptive AI engine for commercial wargames. This capability will be implemented as a system of intelligent agents that collaborate using a Bayesian Blackboard.  A number of decision theoretic models will be enabled that provide computer opponents the capability to effectively simulate a wide range of behaviors that translate into greatly varying tactics, actions, and strategies. Genetic algorithms and Bayesian learning methods will be explored for purposes of creating a strategist that is capable of adapting to changes in opponent strategy and responding agilely when the human locates weaknesses in the computer-generated strategies.  This research will result in a capability to provide an adaptive AI engine for commercial wargames.  There is an immediate application to commercial wargame designers and consumers of commercial wargames.  This includes military training institutions that use commercial wargames to supplement formal strategic and operational planning.  There is additional potential for sales to DoD contractors developing military simulations for US or allied military training.  Finally, the AI engine developed by this research will provide a testbed for advanced tactical fusion research"

        "Abstract": "Inferencing and reasoning algorithms are widely used in various applications where root causes need to be inferenced based on observed evidence. One typical application is fault diagnosis of complex systems based on symptoms reported by various diagnostic monitors. The symptoms may contain both continuous and discrete variables.     Intelligent Automation, Inc. and Professor David J. Miller of Penn State University propose to develop a new inference engine based on Maximum Entropy. The key capabilities include: 1) making principled, effective use of both continuous and discrete features; 2) solving general inferencing tasks, wherein any subset of features may need to be inferred, given values for the remaining features; and 3) handling large feature space. The work is built on efficient learning of maximum entropy Probability Mass Functions (PMFs). Our algorithm avoids an artificial mapping of continuous features, leading to a significant edge in solving mixed feature space inference tasks. Our learning algorithm builds the PMF directly from training data and consequently does not require making any explicit conditional independence assessments as compared to Bayesian Networks (BNs). In Phase 1 we will perform comparative studies between our proposed algorithm and other algorithm candidates. In Phase 2, we will implement the algorithm in real-time."

        "Abstract": "ISX Corporation, in cooperation with SRI International, proposes a research effort to develop a UAV Airspace Management System (UAMS).  UAMS will use advanced artificial intelligence techniques for airspace plan generation and repair in a network aware communications framework. UAMS will consist of 2 major components.  One component, the UAMS Planner, will handle plan generation and monitoring.  The other component, the UAMS Information Dissemination Layer (UIDL), will handle coordinating communications necessary for airspace control.    The UAMS Planner will implement AI reasoning procedures for Airspace plan generation, monitoring and repair. The UIDL will implement an agent-based framework for intelligent information dissemination based on the DAIDS effort.  The UIDL will have the following functions:    Dynamic team formation    Dissemination policy generation.    Communications adaptation.    UAMS will use the most advanced AI techniques available in generating, monitoring, and repairing UAV airspace management plans.  The quality of the generated plans and the ability to rapidly detect and fix conflicts will allow the highest degree of flexibility in UAV operations possible. It will use a software agent-based intelligent information exchange framework to minimize the amount of bandwidth required for airspace coordination, and will be adaptable to support centralized, distributed, or hybrid control protocols"

        "Abstract": "MSI will collaborate with various diesel engine manufacturers to create a Sentient Autonomous Maintainer (SAM) for remote diagnostics, prognostics, and self-maintenance of marine diesel engines for use on Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). This SAM will monitor the engine\u00a1_s current state, predict the engine\u00a1_s future state, automatically correct conditions when possible, and report impending or current failures to the remote controller. The SAM will make use of Bayesian based artificial intelligence algorithms to operate as an automated Prognostic Health Management (PHM) system. The PHM system will collect and fuse operations data with performance data and then use Physics of Failure models to 1) estimate the state of sensored and hidden conditions, 2) predict time to transition to future failure states, 3) estimate the degree (probability) of safety and economic risk in the predictions, and 4) provide accurate decision support. PHM has been shown to be valuable in providing advanced warning of conditions that lead to failure of expensive weapon systems so that Condition Based Maintenance can be performed in a timely and effective manner."

A two year plan is presented that will leverage MA&amp;D&apos;s software development and user interface design expertise and BCI&apos;s knowledge of Naval operations and Track Information Quality (TIQ).  The MA&amp;D team will coordinate with NAVSEA and extend previous TIQ efforts to develop a software tool that will be flexible in design and architecture and will accommodate future advances in information technology.  Data extraction, reduction and analysis previously requiring hours of Subject Matter Expert (SME) intervention will be realized with the aid of artificial intelligence algorithms thereby allowing feedback to the Battle Group Commander, Air Defense Commander and Air Defense Team on a daily basis rather than only at the end of an exercise.  As an option to this SBIR program, we will investigate the feasibility and provide options for developing a real time TIQ capability."

        "Abstract": "We propose to build for the Air Force a next-generation adversary model that can dynamically generate realistic adversary actions in an operational-level predictive simulation.  This system will use advanced artificial intelligence behavior modeling techniques to capture the full range of potential adversary actions and decisions.  It will also model the effects of culture and other extra-cognitive factors on behavior.  The proposed system consists of two components:  an adversary authoring tool and a model execution engine.     The authoring tool will permit military analysts to customize all aspects of the adversary model without the assistance of a programmer.  This tool will feature an intuitive visual editor in which the user can assemble models from basic building blocks by manipulating graphical elements.  Giving analysts direct control over the adversary models will encourage the development of better models.    The model execution engine will use the resulting models to control adversary forces in a simulation.  The engine will include an execution monitor allowing the analyst to observe the changing &quot;mental state&quot; of the adversary as well as to ask for an explanation of any action or decision.  We will absolutely demonstrate the feasibility of our ideas through the development of a Phase I prototype."

        "Abstract": "Ultrasound is known to be an excellent imaging modality for trauma cases due to its portability and versatility.  These factors allow ultrasound to be particularly suitable for battlefield imaging and diagnoses. However, the modest display technology and lack of intelligent systems do not allow battlefield ultrasound to live up to its true potential.  In this work, UtopiaCompression proposes the development of a novel three-dimensional hand-held display device and analysis package that is powered by artificial intelligence and highly sophisticated adaptive models of external and internal anatomy that will dramatically increase the diagnostic power of battlefield ultrasound.  Using this non-invasive diagnostice imaging technology, a medic would be able to gain and utilize information that is currently either unappreciated or simply unavailable.  The power of this medical diagnostic imaging system stems from its adaptive capabilities and its intelligence in localizing anatomy of interest with respect to certain anatomic landmarks and displaying and recognizing known patterns and classifications of normal and abnormal anatomy.  Furthermore, given this intelligence at display and localization and the ability of the system to guide even inexperienced users to acquire diagnostically useful views, the training times of medics performing medical ultrasound on the battlefield should be greatly reduced.  Overall, this system should allow a low cost, highly efficient, and well integrated diagnostic ultrasound system whereby the user is more efficiently engaged with the scanning hardware and imaging tasks. The anticipated result of this research is to produce a user friendly intelligent visual anatomic guidance\/decision support system\/device backed by an effective 3D modeling and visualization technology that can significantly assist army medics in their ultrasound training and decision making."

Specifically, this project will consist of 1) Analysis to identify maintenance related issues such as failure modes, criticality, etc for a selected test bed that will comprise of a critical subsystem or component; 2) Systematic knowledge engineering steps to characterize the maintenance, logistics, and inventory related issues, and to elicit domain as well as control knowledge; 3) Development of a novel architecture and algorithms for the integration of the control knowledge of self-evolution for a continuous improvement process in a feedback manner; 4) Development of testing plan to validate and verify the self-evolving architecture on a subsystem or component; and 5) Software demonstration of the framework.    This proposal involves a novel artificial intelligence technique of reasoning and learning in episodic manner. This methodology forms the core of what is presented as a comprehensive CATER (CAse-based TEmporal Reasning) solution that will exhibit self-evolution process by improving the performance of knowledge-base by observing the feedback generated from multiple sources, such as maintenance logs, IETMs, inventory footprint, component statistics, etc. The solution has a built in capacity to reduce the uncertainty that is inherent in the PHM and maintenance processes."

These tools must be able to swiftly create and assess potential threat and counter-measure scenarios. For several years, Hexagon Interactive has been developing innovative AI technologyfor AFOSR to automate the creation and assessment of friendly and adversarial potential Courses of Actions (COAs). The AI simulates the decision-making processes of human organizations\/populations under conditions of stress and hence provides probabilisticpredictions of their behavior in response to inputs.This Phase I proposes to conduct additional research and implement it in a computer simulation called CYBERWAR XXI ready for verification and validation testing as part of a future effort. The testscenario that Hexagon has been working on since 1998 is Near Future Iraq War.  CYBERWAR XXI expands the definition of weapons system to include not only conventional but also unconventional and unorthodox weapons systems required in asymmetric and operations other than war (OOTW). Taking into account PMESII (Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure and Information), CYBERWAR XXI enables multiple players to roleplay at the strategic level, the National Command Authorities of variouswestern alliance and middle-east nations as well as terrorist organizations.   Increased use of conflict simulations in peacetime training for orders development would help officers execute the staff wargame in a more objective fashion, giving theircommander a better product. Networking technology can enable commanders and staff officers to quickly link their computers for a networked conflict simulation for training and COA development.Since the product is easy to use and will run on easily accessible commercial hardware, it can be used as a training tool providing an inexpensive and easily utilized means of teaching and understanding modern strategic-operational level warfare. Such atool will be invaluable for training personnel in the novel decision-making processes required by asymmetrical and other unconventional modes of warfare.The fully-developed Artificial Intelligence technology will also be a valuable product which will be useful to other DoD programs such as counter-terrorism. Simulations are also a critical part of modern weapons systems developments. They have manyadvantages, including the exploration of alternate strategies and tactics in which these weapons systems can be used, and the prediction of countermeasures, which may in turn be neutralized. Simulations have advantages in saving time, space, manpower andcosts in the training of personnel. They can also be used by policy makers and strategists to determine alternative strategies and tactics.The AI&apos;s ability to model organizational decision-making and cascading effects will be useful in a variety of civilian and business training applications. Disaster relief planners can use the tool to simulate the effects of disasters (natural and man-made)on civilian infrastructure in order to help train decision-makers and responders to maximize the efficiency of their relief operations.Markets for the technology include the US and its allies, including friendly professional military education programs, both in residence and distance learning, as well as US and international college defense studies programs.The potential commercial market is enormous. Using the predictive AI technology in commercial products designed to help corporations analyze their management decision-making processes will make them more efficient and to help them get inside thedecision-making loop of competitors. Businesses will be able to simulate areas of management through the advanced AI autonomous agents in order to predict how best to organize and manage their resources. The engine will also be available for license tocreate entertainment and business strategy games that are currently unavailable in the commercial market. Last year, this represented a 6.9 billion dollar market."

        "Abstract": "Computer wargames and combat simulation software has reached a very high level of comprehensiveness and sophistication in terms of modeling fidelity and the production of accurate results.  However, the development of AI (artificial intelligence) for thesesoftware packages has lagged due to the inherent difficulties in interpreting and managing increasingly complex situations.At the same time, however, the increased complexity of the game system makes a reasonably competent and challenging AI more important than ever, principally becasue it makes operating the game much more difficult for human players.  Thus, in order for theprogram to be accessible, let alone fun and enjoyable, requires that the AI be capable of assisting the player in a wide range of situations.Competent AI also serves the function of being able to provide users of the software with an effective training and learning tool.  By being able to act like a live human opponent, players can see the results or their actions and strategies in a much morerealistic real-world environment, without requiring the time, potential inconvenience or personnel investment required in a multi-human player situation.  The primary benefits of the proposed AI improvements will be that existing and future combat simulations and computer wargames will be more accurate in terms of friendly and enemy force actions, will offer more challenges to players, and will also bemore enjoyable to play.  All of which will increase the overall use of the software in whatever professional capacity it is used, be it as a training tool, an evaluation platform for weapons system or tactics development, or even as a information device toshowcase the effectiveness of new technologies.The commercial benefits from developing an impoved AI along the lines of this proposal are that computer games will become more enjoyable to play, increasing sales, as well as offering developers the opportunity to easily and quickly adjust computer AImodels for specific situations without having to rewrite significant portions of the AI modeling code.  For example, by devising and adjusting a set of standard AI customization values , the differences in the decisions between German, US or Sovietcommanders in World War II can be reflected, resulting in a better game with much less game development time than is currently required."

        "Abstract": "This proposal is for the design and development of a challenging, adaptable, and extendible A\/I system for use in state-of-the-art computer-based wargames.  The development will result in a 3rd generation computer wargame based on modern air power conflictand the ability to apply the technology developed for this project in other wargames ranging from tactical ground-based warfare to naval conflict and others.  The approach will use state-of-the-art A\/I technologies programmed into A\/I components whichthrough well-defined interfaces will allow for a plug-and-play A\/I system.  This will provide for unlimited future development and enhancement.  The results of this proposal can be used in numerous commercial wargames either released by the proposer orunder development.  It will enhance and improve the commercial potential of these games and result in higher sales and revenue.  On the military side, the results of this proposal will provide a highly flexible and extensible AI for military training andplanning.  Both the military student and the military planner will benefit from the more challenging A\/I opponent developed from this proposal."

        "Abstract": "Today&apos;s commercial video surveillance and monitoring (VSAM) systems are capable of producing enormous video streams that are over-whelming for human operators to review. But with automated intelligent interpretation of the imagery we can track and classifymoving objects of interest, collect spatial and temporal motion statistics, and detect anomalous behaviors. We propose to transition image understanding (IU) technologies developed at MIT&apos;s Artificial Intelligence Lab into VSAM systems under development byALPHATECH, Inc. to achieve robust scene interpretation capabilities. Our plan to accomplish this technology transition consists of leveraging high performance motion segmentation, tracking, and classification techniques, identifying their benefits andlimitations, developing application-oriented end-to-end modular system designs, and developing and executing VSAM performance characterization methods. We target unstructured outdoor and indoor monitoring applications in which complete access control isnot feasible. Video-based scene interpretation provides a low-cost information-rich data source that allows us to dynamically characterize activities in these scenes according to both the spatial properties and temporal properties of objects in the scene.By using robust and adaptable video processing technology we achieve effective scene monitoring performance across a wide range of viewing conditions.  We are developing products for (1) security applications, detecting suspicious activity by identifyingtraffic pattern anomalies or by measuring loitering statistics in sensitive regions of interest; (2) traffic flow monitoring, providing live traffic flow feeds, comprising speed and count statistics, for municipal government agencies; and (3) activitycharacterization, defining average traffic patterns as a function of location and time for characterizing shopper preferences and travel bottlenecks."

        "Abstract": "Performance of robotic systems would be enhanced through artificial intelligent fusion of the automatic target recognition (ATR) results (and associated underlying features ) of either a single platform or multiple platforms viewing the target\/object from different position, i.e., multi-look fusion.  Such fusion would be particularly relevant for partially obscured and\/or background blended targets.  We propose a multi-layer perceptron neural net for implementing the multi-look fusion.  This neural net would be similar to that recently used by other ARL ATR researchers.  Performance would be further enhanced by smart fusion of individual sensors classifier outputs, either on the same or multiple platforms, i.e., multi-sensor fusion.  Our approach would start with the fusion scheme being investigated by us under another SBIR for Target Acquisition\/Target Recognition (TATR) encompassing man-in-the-loop decision making.  For the ARL SBIR, we will enhance the TATR fusion scheme by building an artificial intelligent agent that augments and automates aided fusion function, e.g., adaptive thresholding for multi-sensor fusion.  This intelligent agent would also incorporate production rules for associating different views of the same object for multi-look fusion.  the resulting algorithms will be applicable to ATR fusion implementations both on vehicles and fusion stations.  Our multi-look and multi-sensor classifier fusion approaches are very practical for operational scenarios, because neither depends on precise co-registration of the various disparate sensors."

        "Abstract": "The Army has two comprehensive workstation based programs for the processing of data collected by its instrumentation radars.  One program is based on the TMR technology for processing one-dimensional data and the other is based on the CIA technology for processing two-dimensional data.  Both of these interactive programs are capable of extracting considerable information about the motion and dynamics of targets, but only under the guidance of an experienced analyst.  The objective of the proposed effort is to incorporate expert system tools into these programs to reduce the tedium in the processing of data, to enable users with less experience to be productive, and to produce more reliable results. Some of these expert system tools already exist in other programs developed for target identification, so that the proposed effort should be of relatively low risk.  BENEFITS:  The existing workstation based software is already being sold in the commercial marketplace.  The expert system enhancements developed in the proposed effort should create additional demand for the software."

        "Abstract": "The Landing Signal Officer (LSO) faces many challenges.  Although  his primary concern remains safety, he must maintain an extremely rapid  recovery rate.  This dictates small times between each landing, and pressure  to not wave-off unless absolutely necessary.  LSO&apos;s have little time to make the  wave-off decision, must wait until the last possible second, and often may not  have a good definition of what that last second is.  In such a high pressure,  high stakes, and highly time constrained environment, Cognitive Science  Engineering (CSE) is required to determine the critical decisions and the best  methods to support them.  In such a complex, time pressured domain, no one  technique or paradigm is adequate.  Stottler Henke Associates, Inc. (SHAI)  plans to utilize a variety of AI techniques.  In Phase I we will elicit the required  knowledge and criteria from expert LSOs using CSE techniques and  absolutely prove the feasibility of our concepts with the implementation and  evaluation of a prototype.  Our phase I team includes cognitive psychologists  with extensive experience in studying experts confronted with judgments and  decisions in situations marked by high stakes, time pressure, conflicting  requirements and rapidly changing situations; top-notch AI developers; and  an experienced LSO and LSO instructor, Frank Pfeiffer."

        "Abstract": "We propose an innovative architecture for a unique and important class of decision aids.  Traditionally, decision aids have been used to help manage the vast amounts of information that may be pertinent to time-critical decisions.  In contrast, our project will focus on developing a tool that advises human decision makers as to when the assumptions which form the basis of their plans are no longer valid.  The Cooperative Decision Management Tool (CDMT) will track decision rationale and assumptions explicitly, identify invalid decisions, and efficiently propagate information corrections and updates to all affected individuals in a way not currently possible (effectively providing active information filtering, fusion, and prioritization).  The CDMT would be interfaced to current planning, management, and decision support tools, and be useable over computer networks.  The CDMT will include several AI concepts which have been combined into a system of theories, capabilities, and formalisms, explicitly to aid the management and coordination of complex cognitive tasks.  This system (called Redux) has been extensively studied, extended, and tested with real domain problems by Stanford University&apos;s Dr. Charles Petrie, a leading researcher in the field of collaborative problem-solving.  We will prove CDMT&apos;s feasibility by developing a proof-of-concept, limited prototype in Phase I.  BENEFITS: The CDMT will dramatically reduce response time and errors, and will increase the quality of decisions for highly time-constrained, complex, and distributed battle management.  Because this effort directly addresses perhaps the most important issues in military operations the potential military market opportunities are enormous."

        "Abstract": "This proposed effort is for an unclassified research and exploratory development program to adapt AI\/ES software technologies for the design and demonstration of a smart pre-processor for Computational Electromagnetics (CEM).  Despite their inherent power, most CEM tools can challenge even the most proficient user, let alone the novice.  One method of alleviating difficulties is by adapting AI\/ES technologies to establish a user-friendly pre-processor.  This innovative approach employs a knowledge or rule base to assist CEM code users during input modeling tasks, particularly for the detailed definition of geometries, and the automated selection of optimum physics formalisms and numerical solutions.  This will facilitate efficient use of CEM codes and will readily allow a wide range of problems to be addressed.  While it will alleviate the burdensome modeling process often associated with sophisticated CEM codes, it also will establish a foundation for intelligent CEM post-processing.  It will have direct relevance to commercial\/private sector applications and will be marketed as a dual-use technology.  To determine the technical feasibility of developing an enhanced capability for various CEM codes in Phase II, Phase I focuses on the design and demonstration of a prototype tool called the Intelligent CEM Expert System (ICEMES) Pre-processor, for the U.S. Air Force code called the General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems (GEMACS).  ICEMES will convert CAD system model data into a valid EM structure model, or validate user-created models, and store such in a syntactically-correct input format compatible with GEMACS."

If unit players are able to discern &quot;WHAT happened&quot;, there are no correlating displays to provide insights into &quot;WHY it happened.&quot;  During Phase I, our focus will be on the development of trainer-friendly AAR displays that provide a direct comparison of unit performance (WHAT happened) to applicable task standards.  We will also examine the feasibility of using non-network data, as well as Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) network data, to support the production of displays that will provide the AAR audience insights into &quot;WHY it happened.&quot;  Phase I will then examine the feasibility of using an artificial intelligence technology to support automated production of each proposed CCTT AAR display.  We will recommend user interface modifications, any required hardware upgrades, and will estimate the level of effort required to develop software for the recommended functionality.

        "Abstract": "All modern military and commercial organizations rely heavily upon  information processed with networked computers.  In the commercial  world, protection of this information from electronic espionage has  become essential.  In the military environment, information defense,  exploitation, and attack are becoming important components of warfare.   There is a national need to come to terms with Information Warfare (IW) by  developing advanced battlefield technology that can be used both for  protecting and attacking information.  ORINCON and Kaman Sciences Corporation propose the development of  an Information Warfare system that combines Distributed Intelligent  Agents (DIAs) with the leading intrusion detection tool, Ice-Pick.  The  system, called Multi-Agent Information Vulnerability Exploitation System  (MAIVES), uses Ice-Pick&apos;s ability to identify vulnerabilities and distributes  network penetrations using ORINCON&apos;s DIA technology.  MAIVES will  permit distributed, coordinated attacks on network systems as well as  assessment of vulnerabilities and planning of defensive tactics at multiple  levels of information flow for the links and processing nodes of C4I and  similar tactical broadcast systems.   MAIVES facilitates continuing upgrades as new vulnerabilities and new  systems are encountered.  In addition, it will accept products and data  obtained by other information system sources (spin-on), thus keeping  current as new information becomes available.  This powerful system  provides tremendous potential for spin-off to other sectors, including  commercial and other government."

This project will combine object-oriented and distributed computing technologies into an integrated system architecture and design.  Successful techniques from artificial intelligence research and visually effective presentation technologies will also be included in the Phase I design.  A reusable object representation and architecture will be developed which can integrate scenarios from existing systems (e.g., METT-T, ASAS, MCS, CBS, WARSIM, JSIM).  An easy-to-use and and modifiable interface will allow the incorporation of existing tools, or provide the building blocks to develop new tolls for developing and analyzing COAs.  The Phase I effort will produce documentation that describes the architecture and design to be implemented during the Phase II effort.  Additionally, a dynamic storyboard will be produced that will demonstrate the concept of operations of the documented system.  This design will not only be useful to battalion through corps battle staffs, but can also be used in other applications such as WARSIM and JSIM for generating the plans of simulated units."

        "Abstract": "Performance of robotic systems would be enhanced through artificial intelligent fusion of the automatic target recognition (ATR) results (and associated underlying features ) of either a single platform or multiple platforms viewing the target\/object from different position, i.e., multi-look fusion.  Such fusion would be particularly relevant for partially obscured and\/or background blended targets.  We propose a multi-layer perceptron neural net for implementing the multi-look fusion.  This neural net would be similar to that recently used by other ARL ATR researchers.  Performance would be further enhanced by smart fusion of individual sensors classifier outputs, either on the same or multiple platforms, i.e., multi-sensor fusion.  Our approach would start with the fusion scheme being investigated by us under another SBIR for Target Acquisition\/Target Recognition (TATR) encompassing man-in-the-loop decision making.  For the ARL SBIR, we will enhance the TATR fusion scheme by building an artificial intelligent agent that augments and automates aided fusion function, e.g., adaptive thresholding for multi-sensor fusion.  This intelligent agent would also incorporate production rules for associating different views of the same object for multi-look fusion.  the resulting algorithms will be applicable to ATR fusion implementations both on vehicles and fusion stations.  Our multi-look and multi-sensor classifier fusion approaches are very practical for operational scenarios, because neither depends on precise co-registration of the various disparate sensors."

        "Abstract": "EHF SATCOM is designed to provide centralized planning with distributive execution. Communications planning includes the process of CINC and Component Commands generating network requirements and requests to the central planner. The central planner is responsible for developing an appotionment of EHF service resources, which is approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for each CINC which in turn can suballocate those resources to the Component Command or allocate them to specific EHF services . The Component Commands must develop specific resource utilization plans and distribute these to the fielded EHF terminals. Implementation of the EHF services is accomplished by the terminal operators and ensuing management of the services and resource utilization is required. Due to the complexity of the EHF SATCOM systems the planners, implementers and managers require software support tools. These software tools should contain artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to perform integration of a wide variety of input data and provide optimum planning, implementation and management decisions. AI tools or algorithms can be developed to integrate information of associated, but not necessarily directly related topics to ensure that the planning, implementation and management aspects of EHF SATCOM do not violate resource allocations and provide optimized coverage, performance, network configuration and resource utilization."

This dictates small times between each landing, and pressure  to not wave-off unless absolutely necessary.  LSO&apos;s have little time to make the  wave-off decision, must wait until the last possible second, and often may not  have a good definition of what that last second is.  In such a high pressure,  high stakes, and highly time constrained environment, Cognitive Science  Engineering (CSE) is required to determine the critical decisions and the best  methods to support them.  In such a complex, time pressured domain, no one  technique or paradigm is adequate.  Stottler Henke Associates, Inc. (SHAI)  plans to utilize a variety of AI techniques.  In Phase I we will elicit the required  knowledge and criteria from expert LSOs using CSE techniques and  absolutely prove the feasibility of our concepts with the implementation and  evaluation of a prototype.  Our phase I team includes cognitive psychologists  with extensive experience in studying experts confronted with judgments and  decisions in situations marked by high stakes, time pressure, conflicting  requirements and rapidly changing situations; top-notch AI developers; and  an experienced LSO and LSO instructor, Frank Pfeiffer."

        "Abstract": "The current Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) OPFOR does not provide a realistic interactive opponent for the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT).  This problem exists because the SAF in CATT only encodes Soviet doctrine utilized in Central Europe.  The U.S. Army does not anticipate meeting an army based on Soviet doctrine in Central Europe, therefore the U.S. Army requires a more varied SAF OPFOR.  The unbounded domain of all potential infantry actions precludes an exhaustive state space search for deriving the optimal tactics, so a modern SAF OPFOR should be based on the varied doctrines and terrains that exist in the world.  To do this, requires artificial intelligence techniques for the rapid implementation and merging or tactics from a large pool of possibilities.  The best potential tactics are dependent on weather, equipment, terrain, and may other factors.  The amalgamation and choice of tactics will give an effective an unpredictabe SAF OPFOR based on the conditions and the equipment OPFOR is given.  Friendly SAFs must also behave in a realistic manner in a wide variety of situations for an effective training experience, so for all SAFs, a rapid easy method of producing realistic behavior must be achieved.  In addition to CCTT, other simulations, including DIVE will require automated infantry agents. SHAI and RDC are already will acquainted with these projects and the capabilities necessary in SAF for an effective training environment.  The prototype automated agents proposed could be interfaced to either simulation or any other simulation at the Army&apos;s request.  In addition the mechanism for rapid production of agents proposed could be used for future simulations and future modules of existing systems."

Since the representation and automatic execution of tactics is a  complex problem we will take an integrated approach using a  variety of AI techniques. These techniques include  knowledge-based representations (rules, objects), case-based  reasoning, and intelligent entities, techniques we have used  with much success in previous projects.  We will use an  object-oriented (00) paradigm to make the tactics knowledge  highly portable and reusable across different simulations.  The  primary goal is implementation of portable tactics expert  systems for use with different simulations. The general nature  of the schema will be demonstrated by an investigation of  several domains, and prototype implementations in two. We will  devise a method of compiling the knowledge in the general  representation schema into a highly efficient runtime form for  rapid execution, which can be easily hosted on different  platforms and readily interfaced to existing simulations."

        "Abstract": "The information processing tasks associated with defense application, such as Automated Target Recognition (ATR), have very diverse computational requirements that result in different needs for computing systems capabilities.  A &quot;heterogeneous&quot; parallel computing environment provides a variety of architectural capabilities, orchestrated to perform an application whose tasks have such diverse execution requirements.  One form of a heterogeneous computing system is a &quot;mixed-mode&quot; or &quot;reconfigurable&quot; system, where a single parallel machine can operate in different modes of parallelism.  Another form is a &quot;mixed-machine&quot; system, where a suite of different high performance machines are connected together by high-speed links.  A key issue that must be addressed in using heterogeneous parallel computing architectures for real-time information processing is the design of a high-level operating system for matching the processing tasks to the appropriate machine in a mixed-machine parallel system and to the appropriate architecture configuration in a mixed-mode\/reconfigurable parallel system.  This effort seeks to establish the feasibility of a new artificial intelligence (AI) based technique for implementing a high-level operating system for heterogeneous parallel computers.  The proposed intelligent operating system consists of architecture independent, generalized routines that are useful in all parallel computing environments and architecture specific specialization for a given architecture in the form of rules in the rule-base of a knowledge-based system."

Hybrid systems that make use of acoustic and nonacoustic sensors, artificial intelligence (Al), and advanced multisensor fusion technologies are required to provide improved detection and classification performance. To achieve this goal, a design study will be conducted during Phase I of this SBIR contract. Three objectives will be satisfied during the design study phase: first, acoustic and nonacoustic sensor technologies will be Identified and characterized (i.e., report timeliness coverage, etc.) to determine mission applicability; next, hybrid neural network and AI applications will be defined to provide automated detection, classification, and localization estimates to an operationally proven multihypothesis fusion algorithm; finally, the multihypothesis fusion algorithm will be modified to provide final classification and localization estimates using sensor-level detection data from dissimilar types of sensors. During the transition option phase of this program, AI-based intersensor cueing techniques will be implemented and evaluated."

        "Abstract": "We propose an innovatiave combination of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve the Navy&apos;s capabilities and reduce the time required for flight test plan representation and development, and flight data analysis. These capabilities will be available as part of an integrated workstation toolbed. Specifically, we will use AI knowledge representations including frames, semantic networks and rules for capturing plan requirements, components and constraints. We will facilitate plan design through the use of the intelligent entities concept and similarity-based techniques, techniques we have used with much success for the complex planning of NASA&apos;s Space Shuttle missions. We will enhance the Navy&apos;s data analysis capabilities through the application of similarity-based techniques coupled with data reduction techniques. Finally, we will develop a model for integration of existing and emerging flight test planning software, expert systems, data base management systems and data reduction systems. Navy flight test planning has not previously been comprehensively automated and no one before has applied similarity-based techniques to flight test plan development. Phase I research and prototype development will lay the groundwork for the Phase II implementation of an automated planning and data analysis system and the eventual commercialization of the planning system."

The AIDGU will employ artificial intelligence techniques to generate scenarios and data for engagement training systems. The AIDGU will automate training scenario generation, facilitate scenario modification and present an easily used interface to instructors. The AIDGU will be designed to interface with currently deployed engagement training aids. The proposed project (Phase I and Phase II) will result in a detailed task analysis of the automatic data generation process, a requirements specification for an AIDGU and a system to demonstrate the feasibility of building such a system. The Phase I effort will research,and analyze the current data generation process. It will evaluate, quantify and describe current and emerging hardware and software technologies with which to implement the AIDGU. The Phase I effort will also define an AIDGU product to be prototyped in Phase II. Phase I objectives will be accomplished in four tasks: 1) Research data generation requirements; 2) Derive AIDGU system level requirements; 3) Research and analyze alternative technologies and 4) define alternative approaches and designs, and produce the final report."

SCT BELIEVES THAT BY ADAPTING THE SES: A SONAR EXPERT SYSTEM TO ACOUSTIC TORPEDO DATA, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO PERFORM RELIABLE AUTOMATIC TORPEDO DETECTION. THE BASIS OF SES IS TO EXTRACTION THE RIGHT FEATURES FROM THE ACOUSTIC DATA AND APPLY THE PROPER LOGICAL COMBINATIONS TO THOSE FEATURES TO PERFORM ACCURATE SIGNATURE INTERPREATION. CURRENTLY SES IS BEING APPLIED TO THE PROBLEM OF INTERPRETING RECORDED REAL DATA FROM THE SQR-19 SENSOR AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY TO PERFORM LINE ASSOCIATION AND SIGNATURE CLASSIFICATION. THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ADAPT SES TO THE PROBLEM OF TORPEDO DETECTION ARE TO DEFINE TORPEDO SIGNATURE CHARACTERISTICS, ENHANCE THE LOGIC IN SES TO ACCURATELY DISCRIMINATE THESE CHARACTERISTICS FROM OTHER ACOUSTIC SIGNALS, AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE A CLEAR CUT DECISION ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF A TORPEDO IN PASSIVE ACOUSTIC DATA."

THE ORIGINAL MISSION PROGRAMMING, A COMPLEX SOPHISTICATED PROCESS WITH MANY INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS, IS PERFORMED BY THE DEVELOPING CONTRACTOR. IT IS ULTIMATELY THE USER&apos;S RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP MISSIONIZED PROGRAMS FOR THESE SYSTEMS. THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE DEVELOPING CONTRACTOR IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE USER. THE USER MUST BE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY PROGRAM MISSION CHANGES AND DEVELOP REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF HOW THESE CHANGES IMPACT TOTAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPUTER PROGRAM, CALLED AN EXPERT SYSTEM, CAN BE DEVELOPED THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE USER GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CHANGE THE MISSION PROGRAM, WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED RESULT, AND WHAT IMPACTS THE CHANGES WILL HAVE ON OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. IN THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY, MACAULAY-BROWN PROPOSES TO PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE ALQ-136 (SEMA) MISSIONIZATION PROCESS, DETERMINE WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BUILD AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO GUIDE THAT PROCESS, AND DESCRIBE SUCH AN EXPERT SYSTEM, INCLUDING INPUT REQUIREMENTS, OPERATING PROCEDURE, AND OUTPUT RESULTS.

UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, RESEARCH EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PLACED ON SHPE RECOGNITION BASED ON SEGMENTATIONS FROM ODELS AND\/OR SIMPLE SCENES. IT APPEARS THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON SEGMENTATION WITH COMPLEX SCENES HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED. CONSEQUENTLY, THE TOTAL TARGET RECOGNITION SYSTEM SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF SOPHISTICATED CONTOUR EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS IN VIEW OF THE FAWCT THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SHAPE RECOGNIER AND TARGET CLASSIFIER IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE INPUT DATA--THE CONTOURS. THEREFORE, THIS PROPOSED EFFORT IS INTENDED TO FILL THIS RESEARCH GP BY PROPOSING AND TESTING A FAMILY OF AL-BASED ALGORITHMS FOR SEGMENTATION AND CONTOUR EXTRACTION. ACCORDINGLY, TWO SPECIFIC TASKS ARE PROPOSED (1) TO TEST AND FINE-TUNE THE PROPOSED ALGORITHMS USING REAL-WORLD IMAGE DATA; AND (2) TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF A SUB-SET OF SR&amp;E&apos;S AL-BASED ALGORITHMS IN THE C OR FORTRAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AS SPECIALIZED PROCESSORS FOR AIRPLANE CONTOUR EXTRACTION AND GROUND TARGET IDENTIFICATION.

THESE MODELS ARE BASED UPON THEORIES OF HUMAN COGNITIVE PROCESSING AND HAVE SEVERAL USEFUL PROPERTIES. THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AT INTEGRATING TOGETHER IMPRECISE INFORMATION, AND THUS FOR INTEGRATING MULTIPLE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION. THEY CAN ORGANIZE THEMSELVES AS THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCE, AND THUS LEARN TO USESPEECH MECHANISMS FOR RECOGNITION THAT ARE ONLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THEY ARE NATURALLY PARALLEL AND ESPECIALLY SUITED FOR MASSIVELY PARALLEL MACHINE ARCHITECTURES, AND ARE ALSO RELATIVELY INSENSITIVE TO DAMAGE TO MACHINE HARDWARE. THESE PROPERTIES ALLOW SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS TO BE BUILT THAT CAN MAKE USE OF SPEECH INFORMATION THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DO WITH CONVENTIONAL SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION. THEY ALSO ALLOW SYSTEMS THAT CAN OPERATE IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS THAT OF A MILITARY AIRCRAFT. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURES FOR COMPUTER SPEECH RECOGNITION BASED UPON THESE MODELS, BY TRAINING A MODEL RECOGNITION SYSTEM, EVALUATING ITS PERFORMANCE, AND ANALYZING THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IT DEVELOPS."

WE BELIEVE THAT ASKING &quot;HOW INTELLIGENT IS THE SYSTEM?&quot; IS NOT THE CORRECT PERFORMANCE QUESTION AND THAT MORE APPROPRIATE ARE &quot;DOES THE SYSTEM HELP THE USER?&quot; &quot;IN WHAT WAY?&quot; AND &quot;HOW CAN THIS BE MEASURED?&quot; OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT THE USERS, DEVELOPERS, MANAGERS AND FUNDERS OF THESE SYSTEMS HAVE &quot;EXPERT&quot; KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE CAPTURED IF A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION IS TO BE PERFORMED. THE METHODOLOGY WE PROPOSE STRUCTURES THIS KNOWLEDGE BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EVALUATION CONTEXTS, USES A RULE-BASED LANGUAGE FOR EXPRESSING THE KNOWLEDGE, AND EMPLOYS THE MATHEMATICS OF FUZZY SET THEORY TO MODEL THE INHERENT VAGUENESS IN THE KNOWLEDGE. THE PROPOSAL CONTAINS AN OVERVIEW OF OUR EVALUATION METHODOLOGY AND ILLUSTRATES IT WITH A SIMPLE EXAMPLE. WE ALSO DISCUSS THE NEED TO DESIGN A SET OF TOOLS TO HELP OPERATIONALIZE THE METHODOLOGY, AND CONSIDER SOME PILOT EXPERIMENTS THAT SHOULD BE PERFORMED TO VALIDATE THE IDEAS."

THE THRUST OF THE PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP &quot;SYSTEM-BUILD&quot; TOOLSOR SOFTWARE MODULES TO SUPPORT EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPE DEMONSTRATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS\/SEMI-AUTONOMOUS PLATFORM CAPABILITY. AKM ASSOCIATES PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A DEFENSIVE\/OFFENSIVE FIRE CONTROL DECISION AID A (FCDA) MODULE WHICH WOULD BE A COMPANION TO THE AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION (ATR) MODULE WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING UNDER CONTRACT TO ARDC. THESE TWO AI-BASED FIRE CONTROL DECISON AIDS WOULD BE OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE WITHIN THE ADOPTED FINITE-STATE-MACHINE(FSM) STRUCTURE FOR THE WEAPON PLATFORM AUTOMATION: 1) AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION (ATR) IS BASED ON MULTISENSOR INTEGRATION (MSI) AND&apos;EXTRA-SIGNAL&apos; INTELLIGENCE CORRELATION USING TOOLS OF PERCEPTUAL REA-SONING. 2) DEFENSIVE\/OFFENSIVE FIRE CONTROL DECISION AID (FCDA) WOULD ACT AS A TARGETING AID TO THE COMMANDER\/GUNNER. THE TWO MODULES(ATR AND FCDA) WILL BE DEVELOPED TO OPERATE AS STAND-ALONE MODULES OR BE EASILY INTEGRABLE WITHIN THE HIERARCHICAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK OF WEAPON PLATFORM AUTOMATION. FCDA MODULE WILL BE DEVELOPED ON MICROVAX II WITH MICROVMS 3 OPERATING SYSTEM AND USING THE VAXLISP LANGUAGE. SUCH AN IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE COMPLETELY PORTABLE TO ARDC VAX 11\/780 COMPUTER SYSTEM."

THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG RANGE ROUTE PLANNING FOR LAND VEHICLES BY TRANSVERSING CROSS COUNTRY PATHS CREATED BY BOTH A COMPUTER GENERATED DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING MODEL AND BY A MILITARY EXPERT. ADVANTAGES, IF ANY, OF THE EXPERT PLANNED ROUTE WILL BE ANALYZED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) RULES FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE COMPUTER ROUTE PLANNING MODEL. PROBLEMS COMMON TO BOTH ROUTES, SUCH AS OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE AND CHECKPOINT LOCATION, WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR FUTURE STUDY."

DESIGN-FOR-TESTIBILITY AND INTELLIGENT BUILLT-IN TEST ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF AI APPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE SYSTEMS OR THOSE IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE ALSO MANY APPLICATIONS FOR ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS. EXPERT SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE AND DISSEMINATE EXPERTISE, INTEGRATE A WIDE VARIETY OF KNOWLEDGE TYPES, INCLUDING EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES, HEURISTIC RULES OF THUMB, AND DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF THE SYMPTONS IN BRINGING A WIDE VARIETY OF LOGICAL TECHNIQUES TO THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS. AN UNDERSTANDING OF STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF OBSERVED FAULTS. OPTICAL TEST SEQUENCING AND MINIMIZATION ARE ALSO GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE USE OF AI TECHNIQUES. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THE APPLICATION OF AI TO DIAGNOSTICS HAS LARGELY BEEN IN AN EXPERIMENTAL OFF-LINE FASHION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE LINKING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH WILL ALLOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO ACCESS A WIDE RANGE OF STANDARD BUS-DRIVEN INSTRUMENTATION AND ATLAS COMPATIBLE AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT. THESE LINKS WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF ANY NUMBER OF AI TECHNIQUES TO THE SOLUTION OF REAL WORLD MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS. IN ADDITION, AI OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR FAST IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN ATLAS, THE MOST WIDELY USED TEST EQUIPMENT CONTROL LANGUAGE."

THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO OVERWHELMING AN VOLUME AND RATE OF DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR IMPROVING WEAPON SYSTEMS AND EXPANDING THREAT ENVIRONMENT. IMPROVED DISPLAYS AND CONTROLS ARE NO LONGER ADEQUATE TO PERMIT AIRCREWS TO ADEQUATELY CONTEND WITH THEIR NEED TO ABSORB THE AVAILABLE DATA AND MAKE PROPER DECISIONS. ARTITICIAL INTELLLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY IS RAPIDLY SHOWING PROMISE OF PROVIDING A SOLUTION. ARTICICIAL INTELLIGENCE INCLUDES A NUMBER OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. THEIR GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO THE AIRCREW ENVIRONMENT IS NOT DEMONSTRATED. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN EVALUATION WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN REASONABLY BE APPLIED AND RECOMMEND INITIATIVES AND ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP THE POTENTIAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE."

THE PROGRAM WILL ASK THE TECHNICIAN FOCUSED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SYSTEM&apos;STHE QUESTIONS WILL REGUIRE PROBING FOR VOLTEGES, LOGIC LEVELS, ETC. THE INFORMATION GENERATED WILL LED TO MORE QUESTIONS, UTILIMATELY RESULTING IN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPAIR. CORRECT ANALYTIC CONCLUSIONS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE PROGRAM&apos;S MEMORY, REDUCING THE TIME TO FIND THE SAME PROBLEM THEREAFTER. TECHNICIANS WILL BE ABLE TO QUESTION WRONG CONCLUSIONS AND TO UNCOVER THE LOGIC LEADING TO THE ERRORS. MALFUNCTIONS LOCATED BY PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS OR BY TECHINICIANS HENCE INCREASE THE PROGRAM&apos;S KNOWLEDGE. MISTAKES ALSO LEAD TO NEW KNOWLEDGE AND THE FORMULATION OF NEW PROGRAM RULES WITHIN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE. THE PROGRAM AMPLIFIES AND EXTENDS THE TECHINICIAN&apos;S EXPERTISE.

THE QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED BY THIS PROPOSED BASIC RESEARCH IS THE FOLLOWING: CAN AN OPTICAL HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEM EXHIBIT FUNDAMENTAL PRIMITIVES WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR HIGHER LEVEL COGNITION? THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES THE POSSIBILITY OF JUST SUCH A DEMONSTRATION. SINCE THIS RESEARCH DEALS WITH FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF COGNITION, IT COULD HAVE FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELDS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, AND EVEN NEUROPHYSIOLOGY."
