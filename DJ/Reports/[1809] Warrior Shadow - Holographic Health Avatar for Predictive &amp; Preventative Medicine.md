Warrior Shadow: Holographic Health Avatar for Predictive &amp; Preventative Medicine
====================================================================================

# Abstract


Predictive medicine has considerable potential to improve clinical outcomes during the crucial minutes and hours immediately following combat trauma. There is a requirement for an avatar solution that serves a multitude of functions for predictive medicine in the battlefield and beyond, including digital health data warehousing and prediction of immediate and long-term outcomes associated with various combinations of injuries, clinical treatments, and baseline genetic and physiology profiles. The proposed solution will address this requirement by providing a mixed reality, holographic manifestation of a physiologically accurate warrior health profile. The avatar solution will be customizable for individual soldiers, representing past, present, and predicted future medical history, and automatically updatable with mobile health sensor and EHR integration. The proposed effort will focus on the development of a modeling and simulation framework for prediction of immediate and long-term persontreatment interactions following life threatening battlefield traumatic injuries, integrating the digital warrior assets with drag-and-drop user interface functionality. Additionally, this effort will develop the underlying unsupervised statistical learning capabilities within an established, open-source, and scalable artificial intelligence architecture. Product commercialization will emphasize custom, virtual training scenario development based on medically accurate events, with the ultimate objective of an avatar model shadowing every military combat personnel.
