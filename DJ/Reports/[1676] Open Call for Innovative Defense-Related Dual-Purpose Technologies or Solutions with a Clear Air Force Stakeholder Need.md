Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


This Phase I SBIR White Paper describes the Steel Horse Consulting Services, LLC (SHCS) capability to accelerate solutions to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) needs through the establishment of the Air Force Special Operations Technology and Innovation Consortium (AFSOTIC). The goal of the AFSOTIC is to accelerate innovation and technology to address Air Force Special Operations needs in a fraction of time compared to the current acquisition process. The AFSOTIC will apply new processes, provide access to innovation, incorporate autonomous search agents, integrate artificial intelligence software and compress the contracting process into one week or even one day! The AFSOTIC ecosystem will connect and align Combat Mission Needs (CMNS), emergent threats, operational readiness issues, short falls and gaps to innovation and technology solutions with large and small / emerging companies that have not traditionally worked with the military or federal government.
