Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The key focus for this proposal is leveraging Andurilâ€™s existing Lattice Platform technology against new problems: detecting incoming cruise missiles and/or command and control of space assets. This would involve targeted hardware and software upgrades to the existing Lattice products. Andurilâ€™s Lattice Sensor Fusion Platform (â€œLatticeâ€�) is an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that integrates sensor platforms with the latest computer vision technology to provide automated, autonomous, 24/7 object detection, tracking, and alerting and C2 interface.
