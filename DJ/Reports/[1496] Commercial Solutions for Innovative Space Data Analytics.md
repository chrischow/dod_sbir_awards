Commercial Solutions for Innovative Space Data Analytics
========================================================

# Abstract


Smartphone applications commonly have the need to request and receive multiple data streams and present them to the user in a sensible way. Meeting the most aggressive and stringent service levels requires efficient handling of large, disparate and complex data. Our solution improves the way iOS (and Android) applications request, process and display multiple disparate data sets by implementing highly efficient secure streaming parallel data transfer and displays with the use of multiple APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Our patented technology emphasizes security and efficiency with the use of restful APIs, allowing data to be delivered to the end user in a timely fashion, even in degraded environments when connectivity is limited. We focus on collecting and storing end-user preferences and using the information for delivering sponsored messaging. The primary use case is to deliver live event ticket sales and other commercial offers to mobile devices based on user preference, event proximity and user lifestyle analytics.
