# Abstract


This effort concerns the application of new components for Air operations. It involves (1) Artificial Intelligence (improved algorithms, optimized human-machine coordination, and disruption of adversary efforts); (2) Autonomy (teaming of autonomous systems; machine perception, reasoning, and intelligence; human and autonomy systems trust and interaction, and Communications (self-configuring, self-healing and resource allocation).
