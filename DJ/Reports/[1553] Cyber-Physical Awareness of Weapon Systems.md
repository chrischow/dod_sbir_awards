Cyber-Physical Awareness of Weapon Systems
==========================================

# Abstract


Nokomis proposes to work with currently identified Air Force personnel to develop a test trial of commercially and Air Force sponsored cyber-physical awareness technology by identifying Air Force stakeholders. The goal of the Phase I effort is to define, and tailor existing cyber-physical capabilities developed by the NIH and the Air Force to critical gaps in Air Force capabilities. The existing capability is based on monitoring Radio Frequency (RF) emissions to identify cyber-attacks embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Utilizing a combination of machine learning and discreet spectral characterization methods, Nokomis monitors for changes in RF emissions from electronic devices to identify when an attack is occurring and to trigger a mitigation response. The proposed work will be focused on securing government support for a test trail under a Phase II effort and technology transition to the Air Force. Nokomis has demonstrated expertise in utilizing RF measurements in several cyber-physical applications to identify, quantify, and characterize end-point cyber threats. There are two topic focus areas that are relevant to the proposed technology, TFA 4: Fighter/Bomber and TFA 8: Airborne Communications. Both of these areas are looking for cyber-detection capabilities for communications or RF signals on Fighters/Bombers.
