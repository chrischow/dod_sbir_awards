Automated satellite commanding with CNTIENT-SC3
===============================================

# Abstract


Cognitive Space has developed an AI driven satellite command and control solution to respond dynamically to new mission requests. It provides the Air Force with a proactive tool to reduce airmen effort required and more effectively make use of ground and space assets by significantly reducing the time required to issue commands. It accomplishes this by providing a machine learning based command generation system tailored to the specific customer served through a cloud based API. The AFWERX Phase II trial will seek to adapt Cognitive Space's commercial CNTIENT-SC3 product for the automated command generation for Air Force satellites. This effort is directly in line with the company's commercial effort. To accomplish this trial, Cognitive Space will work with the AF customer in integrating the product with existing AF systems, tailoring the product for specific satellite parameters and generating command sequences in both a virtual and operational setting.
