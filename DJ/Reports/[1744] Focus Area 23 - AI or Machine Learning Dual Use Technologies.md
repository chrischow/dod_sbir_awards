========================================================

# Abstract


Discovery Machine, Inc. (DMI’s) objective is to research a hybrid symbolic and statistical representation for mental models that has the potential to overcome the relational and contextual limitations found in current statistical deep learning approaches.   DMI shall leverage the power of SML to recognize patterns in the data (i.e. create classifiers) and match those patterns with existing representations (and partial representations).   Conversely, stored representations shall be provided to the SML algorithms to enable recognition in complex hierarchical settings involving only partial data.   As additional examples are provided the representations shall be adapted to include positive exemplars and to exclude negative instances.
