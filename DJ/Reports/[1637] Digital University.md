Digital University
==================

# Abstract


The Secretary of the Air Force/Chief Information Officer (SAF/CIO) and Business Enterprise Systems Product INovation (BESPIN) have a national defense-related mission need for a Digital University leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. Specifically, the Digital University – part of the “Digital Air Force” initiative – requires capabilities that will enable Airmen to train remotely, using industry leading curriculum, to learn skills associated with a new way of fighting wars. The Digital University (Digital U) needs improved data management and integration that can be delivered by emerging technologies and rapidly deployed to Air Force personnel through a scalable architecture. The Air Force must build resiliency by evaluating, training, tracking, and certifying Airmen against AF-vetted cyber and development paths. Additionally, this initiative will enable AF functional leaders to manage manpower/assignments and facilitate Airmen COVID-19 response while geographically separated from their work centers. Airmen need the ability to browse and conduct online training. By integrating various online commercially available learning platforms, Digital U will provide targeted curriculum that meets the needs of the organization.  Harnessing training data and leveraging advanced analytics and AI capabilities, will provide a best-in-class learning management system for the entire Air Force. Additionally, by integrating with approved Manpower Systems with Airmen training and certification information, Digital University will enable functional leaders to manage manpower and assignments. Omni Federal will use our library of reference architectures, tools, processes, code and testbed to build a customized solution for the Digital U platform.  We will use available data to help develop customized recommendations for each Airman that aligns with their personal profile and history.  AI/ML techniques such as natural language processing, clustering and recommendation systems will be used to personalize and optimize the recommendations to align with individual profiles and overall Air Force needs.  We will also integrate with approved Manpower Systems for evaluating, training, tracking, and certifying Airmen against AF-vetted cyber and development paths and will support manpower/assignments and facilitate Airmen COVID-19 response while geographically separated from their work centers. Omni Federal will also evaluate and integrate with commercial online training platforms such as Udemy and Pluralsight using APIs for modular, extensible and light integration.  This will augment Air Force developed training material and provide a broader set of training options and approaches for Airmen.
