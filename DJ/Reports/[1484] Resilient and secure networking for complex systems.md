Resilient and secure networking for complex systems
===================================================

# Abstract


Resilient and secure networking for complex systems. Operantâ€™s core technology, Named Data Networking (â€˜NDNâ€™), is a next generation networking protocol used for complex and dynamic systems where legacy solutions are not adequate. NDN can be deployed as a replacement, or more commonly, can operate in concert with standard solutions (e.g. IP) to boost a networkâ€™s performance, resilience, and security. Operant provides: Minimized overhead & latency for distributed systems; Advanced Cyber protections; Resiliency powered by machine learning.
