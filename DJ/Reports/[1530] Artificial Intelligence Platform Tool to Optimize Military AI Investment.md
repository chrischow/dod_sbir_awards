========================================================================

# Abstract


Data Society presents a technical quote in response to Topic AF192-001 to the AFWERX Command of the United States Air Force that is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of, and operational and financial gains that would result from, delivering an Artificial Intelligence-powered tool to provide situational awareness across AI and science and technology capabilities to facilitate research and identification of advanced solutions. The Phase I prototype will demonstrate the type of user interface and tool usage that the USAF analysts will expect in the full "CAFÃ‰" tool rollout, to: 1. Accelerate Market Research: a. Make build vs. buy decisions, b. Ensuring compliance to DFAR, FASA, and NIST standards, c. Ensuring you ask for the right capabilities in the RFP, d. Recommend vendors/experts for each requirement, 2. Optimize Investment: a. Identify AI and S&T relationships, b. Awareness to fundamental research; where the global competition is heading & investing, c. Assess the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of a capability, d. Evaluate RFP responses within the context of the capabilities available aligned to mission requirements, 3. Protect U.S. Interests: a. Protect the Defense Industrial Base, b. Track foreign investments & non-notified transactions, c. Deny threat actors, d. SW & HW supply-chain risk; sustainment
