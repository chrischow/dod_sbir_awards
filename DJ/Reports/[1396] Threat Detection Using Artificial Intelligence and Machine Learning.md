Threat Detection Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
===================================================================

# Abstract


Maintaining security at forward operating bases and expeditionary airfields requires autonomous solutions to detect potential threats, such as approaching dismounts, nearby people holding weapons or fast-moving off-road vehicles. In addition to achieving high probability of detection and low probability of false alarm, practical solutions must incorporate: (1) robustness to environmental variability, different types of threats, and confounding background activity; and (2) streamlined set-up, calibration and configuration processes that enables rapid deployment and minimal operator oversight. Our threat detection system for addressing these challenges is designed to integrate information from a scalable, heterogeneous suite of complementary EO/IR/GMTI sensors. We integrate state-of-the art machine learning techniques to classify target types/attributes/behaviors with STR's Multi-Stage Multiple-Hypothesis Tracker to fuse detections from different sensors and track potential threats. A critical contributor to the operational robustness and streamlined deployment process is the application of state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques to address limitations in relevant training data across the different sensors and across the range of sensor viewpoints and scene/target operating conditions. The Phase II effort includes collection of multi-modality training/test data, extensive performance evaluation to characterize threat detection accuracy and robustness, and a live capability demonstration.
