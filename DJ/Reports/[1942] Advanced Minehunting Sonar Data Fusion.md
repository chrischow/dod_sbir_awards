Advanced Minehunting Sonar Data Fusion
======================================

# Abstract


Mine countermeasures is an increasingly important problem, with active SONAR systems being the lead technology for detecting surface and volume mines. Current Navy Minehunting sonar systems consist of multiple independently developed sensors installed on the same towed sensor platform, where the individual data processing streams have left performance gaps in the overall operational utility. Areté Associates proposes to develop a fusion algorithm utilizing the existing volume and side-scan SONARs available on the Navy’s Minehunting Sonars (AN/AQS-20C and AN/AQS-24) to improve detection localization and reduce false detection rates. Our approach builds upon over 30 years of exploiting powerful data analytic tools and previous work with the AN/AQS-20. Phase II of the SBIR will focus on further development of the SONAR Fusion Identification and Localization of Mines (SONARFILM) to meet performance goals and begin the process of transitioning to active systems. Continuing the work started in Phase I, Areté will refine the single sensor false alarm mitigation algorithms, localization algorithm for the forward look sonar, and the multi-sensor and multi-algorithm fusion algorithms. At the end of the phase II option periods, Areté will demonstrate SONARFILM capabilities on a surrogate PMA station.
