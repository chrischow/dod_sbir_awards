Directed Energy Decision Aids
=============================

# Abstract


MZA proposes development of a Directed Energy Environmental Decision System (DEEDS) providing a decision aid combining the use of a scaling law modeling tool, Scaling for HEL and Relay Engagements (SHaRE), that has gone through the formal verification and validation (V&V) process with realistic meteorological conditions. DEEDS makes use of atmospheric profile descriptions generated by the Laser Environmental Effects Definition and Reference (LEEDR) that are based on real-time or forecasted meteorological conditions along with robust modeling of volumetric atmospheric turbulence which is anchored by measurements. The DEEDS interface will provide analysts and operators reliable and realistic estimates of electro-optical (EO) weapon system performance. DEEDS software will incorporate turbulence data into advanced machine-learning algorithms for continual training of turbulence models. Daily and seasonal models will be output in a form easily used by DEEDS (via SHaRE) along with numerical weather forecast data. DEEDS will include EO missions whose operation depends heavily on atmospheric conditions, such as space object surveillance and identification, space situational awareness, as well probabilistic satellite predictive avoidance and collateral effects and risk assessment. DEEDS testing will support collaborative evaluation of laser propagation and active sensors. We will conduct deployment of the DEEDS to support experimental campaigns.
