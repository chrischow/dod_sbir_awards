AF201-CS01: Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose- Focus Area 2: Fighter/Bomber Pitch Day
=========================================================================================================

# Abstract


Demonstrate how ADEPT computing and data handling frameworks will allow the aircraft program to make use of open modeling standards and APIs, Python based analysis and results reporting, and COTS computer servers to implement a purpose-optimized, fully automated, cloud-deployable virtual V&V capability. Furthermore, demonstrate how an ADEPT framework can be interfaced with existing hardware-in-the-loop rigs and connected with machine learning frameworks to generate data driven models for the virtual V&V platform by observing existing hardware operation.
