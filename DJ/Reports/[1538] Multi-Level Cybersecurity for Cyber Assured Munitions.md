Multi-Level Cybersecurity for Cyber Assured Munitions
=====================================================

# Abstract


The USAF AFRL/RW Cyber Assured Munitions (CAM) program has the requirement for high trust multi-level separation / segmentation methods which are compatible with embedded computing hardware and Operating Systems (OS) to protect classified data in storage and in transit during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). A multi-level security solution that separates different classifications for dissemination to end users is a vital requirement to CAM. The technology applies to all other USAF commands. Management Sciences, Inc. (MSI) and our subcontractor, General Dynamics Mission Systems (GDMS), have developed a Multi-Level Security Partition Module (MSPM) that provides comprehensive cyber assurance and cybersecurity protection for multiple levels of classified information on embedded computing devices. The MSPM is built from MSIâ€™s Artificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning engine and GDMS CSfC-certified OKL4 microvisor, which is a GDMS non-defense commercial product offering. MSPM differs from the commercial GDMS OKL4 product because MSPM employs a Separation Kernel/Hypervisor designed and developed for high-assurance systems, and supports full virtualization, enabling guest operating systems (e.g., Wind River OS, Linux, and Windows) and legacy applications to run unmodified. MSI proposes a Direct to Phase 2 that will develop and deliver a Trusted Information Assurance (TIA) product for protecting munitions from cyber threats.
