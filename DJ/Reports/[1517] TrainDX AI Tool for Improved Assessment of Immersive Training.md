TrainDX AI Tool for Improved Assessment of Immersive Training
=============================================================

# Abstract


The potential benefits of immersive training and simulation for pilots and other operational personnel are unchallenged. But these benefits may not be fully realized by the current practice of assessment, which depends almost entirely on instructor appraisal in combination with post hoc exercise review. Training readiness would be greatly enhanced and dependence on and variability of instructor evaluation experience and expertise would be reduced by a universally applicable assessment system that automatically captures, fuses, stores, and evaluates performance data gathered during the immersive training exercise, rapidly presents a comparison to standards, helps to create an immediate after-action review, and requires minimal instructor/evaluator effort. Perceptronics Solutions proposes to provide the AF with the Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) TrainDX solution. TrainDX is an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system that will significantly improve all forms of Air Force immersive and simulator training assessments. TrainDX is employed today and customized for the US Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate and for NAVSEA Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS-5). TrainDX proves Perceptronics Solutionsâ€™ strong reputation for successfully transforming research and development products into fielded and commercially viable systems. This AI solution encompasses causal modeling, machine learning, multi-agent computing, and cognitive science algorithms.
