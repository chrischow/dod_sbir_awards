Focus Area: Fighter/Bomber Pitch Day &quot;Distributed Analytics for Lifecycle Management&quot;
===============================================================================================

# Abstract


Phase 1 will demonstrate feasibility for Fighter/Bomber lifecycle management multi-domain, multi-modal, and distributed decision support system that provisions data ingest, data interrogation with machine learning/artificial intelligence, and orchestration delivery of information globally and locally, including cursor on target environments. The unmatched system provides both a secure .mil cloud and data exchange, and also an unmatched distributed edge as a service set of systems (hand size devices combining sensing, network, ML/AI, and compute â€“ wearable, mountable, stationary). The COTS-based, MIL-SPEC A2/AD resistant edge as service capabilities provide ultra-secure multi-level and joint data collecting and analytics, even in high interference and contested environments, and can do so in isolated and disconnected scenarios ensuring continuity of edge operations in the event of lost northbound comms. This capability allows for a wide range of applying analytics, whether ML, AI, or DL, in enterprise settings and at the edge nearest the operation of tactical, production, logistics, or sustainment/MRO. In Phase 1 the objective is demonstrate the core functionality and potential foundational technology to address the data sharing and analytics request for Fighter/Bomber lifecycle areas, and to validate the feasibility potential across a range of Fighter/Bomber use cases.
