# Abstract


Asset location and tracking across a military base is problematic at best. Tracking or real-time location of vehicles, equipment, assets or other trackable items is highly problematic in hangers, inside buildings or underground. To track these assets requires a costly and burdensome infrastructure upgrade to implement RFID or RF triangulation systems and both systems have limited capability. Ubihereâ€™s intelligent location tagging system is capable of successfully locating and tracking assets with a high degree of precision in real-time GPS denied environments such as indoors, underground or in hangers. The low-cost, long-battery tags have onboard machine learning and a radio communication system which calculates location and stores the information until requested for inventory or access location. The system is currently being developed to manage inventory, equipment and people location and tracking indoors for hospitals, retail, warehouses and manufacturing. Ubihereâ€™s solution also offers the potential to track vehicles, people or assets in outdoor environments without GPS.
