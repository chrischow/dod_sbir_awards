Sustained Maintenance Planning Software
=======================================

# Abstract


Frontier Technology, Inc. (FTI) will develop and demonstrate an innovative, predictive condition-based maintenance forecaster that detects and diagnoses system performance degradation and forecasts time to failure as a means of reducing maintenance costs and increasing operational availability.The inability to anticipate corrective maintenance results in unscheduled outages that increase mean time to repair, decrease operational availability, and drive up costs.The forecaster will monitor system performance in real time, detect indicators of degradation and failure, diagnose the cause with a low probability of false alarm, determine time to failure and mission impact, and report to system stakeholders. The ability to predict the window for corrective action before an unscheduled system failure enables maintenance to be scheduled with the optimum use of time, people, tools and spares.The forecaster technical foundation consists of data-derived system performance analysis algorithms and processes using statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning and signal processing. At the completion of the project FTI will have demonstrated a forecaster that meets the requirements of the topic, can produce a report such as report such as, hardware A has a 90% probability of failure within the next 72-96 operating hours andcan meet the operational needs of the Navy.
