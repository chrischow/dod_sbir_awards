Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC) Fault Detection, Localization, and Isolation
=================================================================================

# Abstract


The ISSAC Team leverages existing knowledge and expertise in power system monitoring, fault identification, localization and isolation in conjunction with rich, deep data analytics for pattern matching to devise a system for Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC) power system fault management. Because of the differences between AC and DC power grids there are a significant number of problems in dealing with faults in the network in a cost and size effective manner. Therefore, the ISSAC Team will use the Phase I period to conduct a number of research and design efforts leveraging existing works by the ISSAC Team, other industries and academia to determine possible techniques, tools and methodologies to address the Navys MVDC fault issues. The ISSAC Team recommends individual technologies and methods and composes an architecture that form the foundation for Phase II efforts and productization and future commercialization. The technologies proposed are fundamental technologies that ensure the success of MVDC ships and other DC grid technologies both federally and commercially.
