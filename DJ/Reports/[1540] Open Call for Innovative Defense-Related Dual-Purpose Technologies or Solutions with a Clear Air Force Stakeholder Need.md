Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings cybersecurity risks that pose a significant threat to the nation, organizations, and individuals. Securing these devices is a major challenge with malicious actors are constantly looking for new and creative ways to exploit these devices to cause mayhem and chaos to our society. The Fortifyedge EdgeSecure product addresses the cyber security challenges introduced with IoT delivering: â—� Physical and Digital Device Security via sensing behavioral and environmental factors specific to each device, allowing the identification of threat-based anomalies â—� Identification of Person & Non-Person Entities via unique fingerprint generation specific to the learnt behavioural characteristics of each deployment â—� Authentication of Person & Non-Person Entities via second-factor continuous authentication allowing seamless movement and generating security events from anomalies detected in the behavior and usage patterns. Fortifyedge has developed a proprietary technology that utilizes embedded systems unsupervised machine learning to provide on-device identity assurance and anti-spoofing. â—� CPU-only unsupervised machine learning requiring a minimal 8K storage to construct a behavior-based unique fingerprint per person or non-person entity. â—� Compiled in â€˜portable Câ€™ making it hardware agnostic and ultra-efficient, embedded on low-compute, low-power devices utilizing ambient sensor data.
