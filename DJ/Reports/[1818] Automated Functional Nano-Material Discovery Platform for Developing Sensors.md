Automated Functional Nano-Material Discovery Platform for Developing Sensors
============================================================================

# Abstract


Triton Systems will design, build, and test a novel nanoparticle synthesis platform for use in application-specific soft sensors. This work will enable a disruptive advancement in development of self-directed machine learning (ML) algorithms for new materials discovery and sensor design. The development of this material and device will yield a rich data set of interrelated structure-function-manufacturing data suitable for training ML algorithms and high-throughput robotic systems to discover new device architectures and nanomaterials based on operating and environmental requirements.
