Shield AI Proposal
==================

# Abstract


Shield AI develops artificial intelligence (AI) for multi-agent unmanned systems (UxS) in support of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).  This work entails the development of Mission Executive software which enables a collection of aerial effects (UAS) to execute coordinated autonomous behaviors while remaining responsive to the environment and input from the human-on-the-loop.  Shield AI has developed Mission Simulation software that allows a user to efficiently design, develop, test, improve, and implement autonomous capabilities for UAS.  The proposed effort will establish the feasibility of integrating an AI architecture for mission execution, developed and tested in simulation, with an existing UAS.   This proof of concept will enable a conventional UAS to “play back” a reactive mission profile learned in simulation.  The effort anticipates a Phase II objective of achieving online integration of the Mission Executive with an existing UAS using standard interfaces to allow for dynamic, autonomous RSTA mission execution by one or more platforms.
