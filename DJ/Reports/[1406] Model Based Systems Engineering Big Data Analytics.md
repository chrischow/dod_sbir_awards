# Abstract


Securboration Inc. will focus on Pre-milestone A and develop an innovative tool to support Systems Engineering Enhancement of Digital-thread (SEED).Pre-milestone A was selected since it will have the greatest impact on the acquisition process if SEED is able to provide a living Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)/Draft Capabilities Development document that will be used to drive the Digital Thread/Digital Twin (DT/DTw) in support of future weapon system development, deployment, and maintenance milestones.The living AoA document is the center of the rapid evolution and refinement of requirements based on the concept of informed acquisition and the ability to support acquisition decisions based on past research and validated models.
