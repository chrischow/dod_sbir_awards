Efficient Fiber Optic Examination and Cleaning Tool
===================================================

# Abstract


To address the Air Force need for automated fiber optic interconnect cleaning/inspection, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Efficient Fiber Optic Examination and Cleaning Tool (EFFECT) that combines both the inspection and cleaning processes in an entirely self-contained, body-worn, hand-held device with intuitive operation.  The EFFECT system integrates advanced optics, artificial intelligence, and automated cleaning and debris removal (solvent delivery, debris vacuum, and inert nitrogen gas drying) with a novel adaptor system to accommodate virtually all form factors of fiber optic interconnects.  Body-worn solvent and inert gas reservoirs, a vacuum system, and battery packs allow for operation in tight, confined spaces where aircraft/vessel power is not readily available and the use of innovative quick-connect adaptors (QCAs) affords the ability to effectively restore functionality in under 1 minute to the various interconnect architectures exposed to contaminants when removing line-replaceable units (LRUs).  In Phase I, POC will define the variables for inspecting and cleaning fiber optic interconnects and fabricate a technology readiness level (TRL)-3 prototype.  In Phase II, a rugged prototype will be demonstrated to show its feasibility to perform terminus endface restoration in realistic military avionics connector environments at TRL-5.  BENEFIT:  The use of fiber optics for data transmission has tremendous applications in both military and commercial environments.  With its many benefits over standard coaxial and copper lines, the use of optical transmission is growing exponentially, particularly in the telecommunication industry, which has invested a considerable amount of money in providing infrastructure directly to consumer households.  Unfortunately the fragility and susceptibility to signal degradation requires continued maintenance that can be time consuming without proper equipment.  EFFECT will greatly help reduce this maintenance burden with an effective system that is efficient and intuitively operated with negligible infrastructure needs.
