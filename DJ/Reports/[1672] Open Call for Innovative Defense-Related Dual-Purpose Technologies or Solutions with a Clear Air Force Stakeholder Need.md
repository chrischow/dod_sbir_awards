Armored Things is a leading innovator in the intelligent security and operations of large venues and campuses, working to help security and operations personnel more effectively manage their environments. Our software-only spatial intelligence platform fuses data from existing physical security and IT infrastructure (ex. Video, Wi-Fi) to provide a heat map of people and movement across space in real-time, historically, and predictively. Additionally, Armored Things incorporates Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to analyze data and provide actionable insights to security and operations personnel to improve their overall response time.
