AUTOMATED VEHICLE MAINTENANCE AND SERVICING USING ROBOTIC COMPUTER-VISION TIRE CHANGING CONTAINERS
==================================================================================================

# Abstract


Ground mobility support plays a critical role in United States Air Force's preparedness level, as the speed, efficiency and cost of deploying provisions (equipment, fuel, tools and manpower) and troops enables USAF readiness and responsiveness. The vehicles and infrastructure used to transport and mobilize vital provisions, and for troops to be mobilized to and from the battlefield, must be frequently maintained to facilitate reliable and cost-efficient mobilization efforts. The USAF utilizes several types of ground vehicles for special operations and to deploy provisions and personnel, including supply chain vehicles and combat vehicles, and are seeking new and innovative technologies to automate vehicle maintenance and service processes ("Automated Fleet Management"), and to increase the efficiency of mobility by reducing the time and cost of repairs and upkeep.  Robotire Inc. has developed a standalone Robotic Container which utilizes Computer Vision Cameras (CS), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to identify a vehicle and perform a fully automated tire change in a swift and precise manner. Robotire's automated process ensures precision and vastly reduces the total time needed to replace 4 tires to approximately 10 minutes. The automated container systems, equipped with vehicle monitoring and diagnosis features, allow for better control and tracking of a vehicles condition and the state of wear-and-tear of the tires, providing additional information regarding the way the driver is using the vehicle and the overall maintenance condition of the vehicle. Each Robotic Container is an independent unit, such that they can be deployed separately, or can be combined into larger units depending on the volume of traffic or parts needed for a specific location. Moreover, the container units can be self-sufficiently powered by solar panels, allowing them to be remotely deployed without additional infrastructure and energy requirements. The Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) facilitates the logistics behind AF mobilization. At the core of this effort are Automated Fleet Management initiatives, to ensure timely responsiveness and operational readiness of supply chain vehicles. Similarly, the Special Operations Command (AFSOC), which deploys troops and equipment (including multi-purpose combat vehicles) in operational territories, is a prime candidate for implementing the Robotire solution for remote operations. During this Phase I project, Robotire's objectives will include contacting the relevant AF stakeholders, evaluating the technical feasibility of reaching their objectives, determining the most appropriate pilot project and partnering with a team to design a technically achievable pilot plan. This Phase I will directly inform the design and implementation of a prototype system during Phase II with the identified Air Force partner.
