Model Based Systems Engineering Big Data Analytics
==================================================

# Abstract


The main goal of this project is to provide the capabilities for enhancing the analytics needed for the realization of the concepts of Digital Thread and Digital Twin. The main technical objective is to develop, prototype, validate and demonstrate the enhancements of data analytic capabilities by leveraging semantic technologies. The approach will be implemented in a full prototype of the system termed Semantic Big Data Analytical Foundation for a Digital Thread (SemThread). The main domain for this project will be Radar Systems. Consequently, the approach will be applied to the new acquisition program â€“ SENSR â€“ sponsored by the FAA, DoD and DHS. The SemThread system will include tools for extracting information from unstructured data sources using Big Data Analytics tools, mapping the extracted data to ontologically based semantic representations, translation of outputs of MBSE tools, e.g., SysML, to formal representations, and integrating the information from disparate data sources. SemThread will support capability gap analysis, Analysis of Alternatives, design space exploration and discovery of new capabilities through the process of automatic inference on the formal semantic representation of integrated information. In this effort, VIStology will closely collaborate with Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS).
