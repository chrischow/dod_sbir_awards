Command and Control for Embedded Systems
========================================

# Abstract


MaXentric’s NAVAIR Embedded Assessment System (NEAS) offers a command and control methodology for embedded sensors. NEAS is designed to operate in challenging scenarios, such as weapons effect damage assessment of hard and deeply buried targets. NEAS corrects for deficiencies that are inherent with embedded sensory systems, such as limited communication links, low computational power, small processor memory sizes, noisy sensors, and sensor failure. NEAS enables advanced methods of exploiting embedded sensor networks through two innovations: a novel embedded processing architecture, and an artificial intelligence approach to network behavior. These two features enable dynamic command and control of event reporting, data filtering, collaboration, and data fusion. Phase I efforts focus on evaluation of the feasibility of the sensor network formation, its operation and viability of the sensor data collection, and its data exploitation methodology. BENEFITS: MaXentric’s NAVAIR Embedded Assessment System (NEAS) lays a dependable foundation for effective deployment and operation of embedded sensors, and is thus well positioned to capitalize on this critical demand from both government and commercial markets. Embedded sensors are envisioned to be the “eyes” and “ears” of a modernized U.S. military. MaXentric’s NEAS enables U.S. forces to use embedded sensors to increase precision, lethality, and efficiency. Some prime examples are battle damage assessment, combat power estimation, and portside security.  In the long term, embedded networked sensing systems will be found almost everywhere, from the car to the hospital operating room and to the home. MaXentric’s NEAS Command and Control interface for these “smart” embedded sensor networks will enable revolutionary technologies, including Mass Transit Automation, Autonomous Building Management, and Smart Cars.
