Adaptive Prognostics Tool (APT)
===============================

# Abstract


Intelligent Automation, Inc. along with Boeing Corporation, Integrated Shipboard Systems (ISS) proposes to develop the Adaptive Prognostics Tool (APT) to support Field Engineers (FE), troubleshooting critical submarine navigation system: Electrostatically Supported Gyro Navigator (ESGN) Stable Platform and Housing (SP&H). IAIs APT will adhere to Naval Open Architecture guidelines and improve maintenance efficiency by presenting troubleshooting recommendations based on historical data of faults and available resources. APT is a self-learning, adaptive software tool primarily designed for field engineers to quickly diagnose and provide repair recommendations. APT will keep track of all sensor inputs to develop a probability metric of future failure within a patrol period, so when in port the FE can perform preventative maintenance. APT will consist of advanced Prognostics and Machine Learning Algorithms that will be part of Submarine Knowledge Base (SKB) and a more general fleet wide Global Knowledge Base (GKB). User-Centered Design (UCD) process will be used to develop a Human Machine Interface for APT. APT will increase mission readiness while at the same time reducing Total Ownership Costs (TOC).
