Demonstration of Descartes Labs Geospatial Cloud Analytics Platform for Change Detection, Fine Grain Classification, and Object Re-Tracking in Support of Air Combat Command Distributed Common Ground System
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The goal of this project is to work with ACC Information Superiority Division to assess the feasibility of Descartes Labs geospatial analytics platform to support in the development of requirements as outlined in the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station (AF DCGS) Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) Algorithm Functional Requirements Document. Descartes Labâ€™s technology has the potential to lighten the cognitive load of AF DCGS analysts through automated processes such as vehicle classification, temporal spatial correlations, and streaming vector layers derived from geospatial analytics. Our software is providing transformation solutions for major Fortune 100 organizations, helping the United Nations model the impact of climate change, and developing famine models from remote sensing modalities around food insecurity in North Africa for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
