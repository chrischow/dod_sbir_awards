ExoBoot Augmentation for Air Force Stakeholders
===============================================

# Abstract


In 2014, MIT researchers (now Dephy co-founders) developed and published the first autonomous device to improve walking efficiency. Since then, Dephy’s ExoBoot system has been further improved to reduce metabolic consumption, increase speed, and mitigate load carriage. User testing has confirmed functional improvements and that the ExoBoot is comfortable to wear, easy to don/doff and requires no training.  Onboard artificial intelligence (AI) quickly adapts to each user’s unique walking patterns and feels like a normal boot when unpowered.  The benefits seen by current users are believed to apply to warfighters that face similar challenges such as those faced by Airmen in execution of various missions, and in various environments.  As a primary objective for this Phase II effort, it is proposed that user testing of the ExoBoot be conducted for user groups within the Air Force to collect real-world feedback, including modifications of the ExoBoot that may be required to meet Air Force mission needs.   A secondary objective is an evaluation of ExoBoot AI and controls settings in these variable environments.  A third objective is collection and analysis of user feedback to inform future ExoBoot iterations to enhance performance of the fielded solution across targeted missions.
