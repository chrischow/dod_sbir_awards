Assessing Economic Ramifications of Pandemics on the Defense Industrial Base
============================================================================

# Abstract


WW Technology Group’s (WWTG) proposed effort combines big data analytics (BDA) with modeling and analysis to provide a sustainable economic assessment of the effects of pandemics on the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and DoD supply chain. The BDA approach will form an ontological data model, which is the foundation for the supply chain model.  Further, it will provide traceability of all analyses and recommendations to their source data and assumptions.  By incorporating the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is available in a machine-readable format, in the model, the legal basis for recommendations can be automatically included in reports. The methodology will leverage WWTGs model-based design and analysis tool, the EDICT Tool Suite, which includes a BDA component.  Recommendations will be generated via a multi-criteria decision analysis method and an uncertainty analysis will be used to assess their associated risks.  Given the complexity of the DIB/DoD supply chain, decision makers understand both the pandemic-related risks and their decision-related risks to avoid mitigating their mitigations.  The proposed BDA/model-based approach is essential to account for the complexity of the DIB/DoD supply chain.
