Innovation Scale R&amp;D
========================

# Abstract


Technology to be validated during Phase I: User Playbook - step by step guide for the ideation process available to download from any airman user location Digital Innovation Dashboard - available to all bases to view ideas in the pipeline, data analytics of ideas in flight and status in the playbook The technology we intend to deliver during our research and development phase is validation of requirements to build a dashboard/platform for tracking varied data analytics throughout the digital innovation pipeline.  We also intend to produce a repeatable curriculum/playbook that allows airman to access the step by step process for idea creation at any time at any location.  The R&D phase will allow our team to determine the level of technology required to develop for all MAJCOM wants and needs. We will conduct interviews with key stakeholders and data stream mapping to identify an initial set of requirements.  Dashboard technical requirements will be evaluated to provide administrators and teams a way to track ideas through the playbook phases.  The curriculum/playbook will also be validated to fine tune the learnings  and streamline the process to pitch and receive idea funding and then move into the project technical validation phase.
