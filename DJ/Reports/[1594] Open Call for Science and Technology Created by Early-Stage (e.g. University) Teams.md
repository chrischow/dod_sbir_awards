# Abstract


Wearable sensors permit the measurement of bio mechanical, physiological, and biochemical parameters relevant to assessing the health and wellness of individuals in a continuous and non-invasive manner. The ability to monitor core body temperature to mitigate illnesses manifesting from overexposure to the heat remains an unmet medical need. Current standard of care towards this front involves rectal thermometry; however, this measurement modality is not practical for athletes and military personnel wherein non-invasive and unobtrusive measurements are required to to enable them to perform at their highest levels while remaining safe. The PrediCOR team has performed an initial market survey of the wearable temperature sensor market. A key conclusion from our research is the lack of such a technology in the market today capable of non-invasively and continuously measuring core body temperature. Thus, this Phase 1 STTR proposal seeks to address this technological and clinical gap leveraging our previous and current work in wearable sensors, machine learning, and predictive analytics. Results disseminating from this proposal will result in the first wearable device capable of accurately measuring core body temperature to reduce injury burden in athletes of all ages and our military.
