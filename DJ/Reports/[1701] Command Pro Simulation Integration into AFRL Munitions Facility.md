Command Pro Simulation Integration into AFRL Munitions Facility
===============================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has a current need for an agile, effective, simulation software that can deliver warfare data analytics for decision makers, budget analysts, and operations research analysts.  Specifically the Munitions Directorate AFRL/RW seeks to provide the knowledge and modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) capabilities required to support the design, assessment, and transition of advanced munition systems and subsystem technologies.  A COTS solution in this proposal consists on what has become the premiere choice software that meets this requirement and is called COMMAND Pro Edition (CPE).  This project intends to develop and expand this software and capability from a single operator to a multi-operator / multi-player platform that will enable on-premise networked use.  Multi Domain capability will expand the simulation from a one room operation to a networked simulation capability that will produce unrivaled vetted data analytics.  This level of collaboration will produce decision vetted information to shape SAF/AQ munition RDT&E budgets and provides decision support. This enhanced modeling and simulation clearly meets Idea 1853 Command and Control Operations Simulator App mission needs and applies directly to 9 out of 15 focus areas of this AF193-CSO1 topic.  Development innovation includes multi-player, cyber attacks, 64 bit, sensor deployment, energy usage, weather effects, and artificial intelligence.   AFRL has signd and provided an MOU, dated 26 Feb, 2020, supporting this Phase II project.  The MOU states "The SBIR II effort, if successful, will be an integral part of the overall AFRL/RW plan."  The Air Force need focuses on a newly built $12M Secure Munitions Modeling and Simulation Facility facility that needs a proven COTS solution. AFRL in-kind support to this project includes testing, prototyping, and evaluating the SBIR Phase II project.  The key simulation COTS software COMMAND Pro Edition, is a mature TRL (Technology Readiness Level) level 6 and will finish this project at the TRL 9 level.  This TRL level assures minimum risk for the Air Force.  The TRL is gained from years of commercial development.  COMMAND Pro Edition was released in 2012 and benefits from hundreds of thousands of users worldwide and continual upgrades to meet product satisfaction. The robust software has not gone unnoticed in the DOD and other military customers.  It has been prototyped in the AF at the AFWIC  organization, at AFRL/XP, and at the Fives Eye nations. Since its introduction to military customers in 2016, it has become the premier wargame of choice.  This project will integrate the COTS capability into the $12M AFRL/RW Modeling and Simulation facility located at Eglin AFB.
