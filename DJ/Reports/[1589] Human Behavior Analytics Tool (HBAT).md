Human Behavior Analytics Tool (HBAT)
====================================

# Abstract


IntelliGenesis seeks to lower the incidence of military personnel and veteran suicide through innovative machine learning and data science approaches applied to military personnel data. Our developers, engineers, and analysts, in coordination with university subject matter experts, will collaborate to design and develop an analytic system capable of ingesting and normalizing personnel (non-medical) data sets, then define indicators and risk factors within the data to create an automated suicide-risk detection engine. IntelliGenesis will lead development of the system and its analytics, and incorporate specific domain expertise from our university partner to capture the nuanced signs and patterns that may be present within a given data set that can lead to an accurate determination of a target's potential risk.
