Optically Reconfigurable Smart Deployable Materials for Future Satellite Applications
=====================================================================================

# Abstract


In this proposal, Bluecom Systems proposes to develop a framework in designing and manufacturing smart materials that can be used as adaptive radiating structures to operate at different frequencies, with different radiation patterns, and achieve polarization diversity. The solution proposed, based on optically pixilated Silicon or GaAs surfaces, can be used as reflective surfaces for reconfigurable reflect arrays, reconfigurable active and modular antennas, or reconfigurable wiring of data lines. The optical reconfiguration on thin silicon/GaAs foldable material, in conjunction with machine learning based activation control, allows autonomous operation of such antennas and the capability to display various modes of operation. This approach eliminates the need for multiple antennas in small satellites and other platforms.
