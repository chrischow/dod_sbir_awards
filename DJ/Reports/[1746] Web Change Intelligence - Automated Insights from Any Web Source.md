# Abstract


Fox and Geese LLC's flagship product, Versionista, provides cloud-based web change intelligence. We surface these in side-by-side summaries and email reports of key detected changes. We propose to extend our product to incorporate off-the-shelf machine learning to better detect significant changes for Defense use cases.
