Large Volume Dataset Analysis Through High-Performance Compute (Hardware and Software) Using Machine Learning
=============================================================================================================

# Abstract


The overall research objective is to demonstrate advanced heterogenous computing solutions using widely available and relatively inexpensive commercial off the shelf technology. This solution will minimize SWaPC requirements for AI/ML applications, affording access to AI/ML solutions on the edge or accelerated performance of existing infrastructure. This solution will demonstrate the benefits of a heterogeneous compute environment to image processing and data analysis like packet capture (PCAP).
