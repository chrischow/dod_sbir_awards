AI Coaching for Virtual Reality Training
========================================

# Abstract


Moth + Flame, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Department of Immersive Storytelling and Emerging Technologies, will study the impact of an artificial intelligence instructor in virtual reality for training. The study will examine learning outcomes in training using traditional materials vs. virtual reality simulations in combination with an AI-powered instructor. This study will apply conversational methods of learning via an AI instructor and measure the impact on study participant’s learning retention immediately after training, 2 weeks after training and 1 month after training. The study will also examine the amount of time it takes students to master skills across the two mediums of learning (traditional, virtually reality with an AI instructor). The study will utilize Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Training Evaluation Model to evaluate the efficacy of the 3 forms of instruction.  The Johns Hopkins University Immersive Storytelling and Emerging Technologies Lab has experience studying the impacts of virtual reality environments and has partnered with other departments across the university including the JHU School of Education and the JHU School of Medicine to produce world-class research. Moth + Flame’s natural language processing technology, machine learning capabilities and virtual reality simulations have already been deployed successfully with Air Force customers. We believe that through this study, we will be able to demonstrate increased retention and faster training time for training via an AI instructor in a virtual reality simulation. With these results, we can establish an effective AI-driven VR training program that can be integrated into Air Force programs such as Agility Prime’s eVTOL platforms.
