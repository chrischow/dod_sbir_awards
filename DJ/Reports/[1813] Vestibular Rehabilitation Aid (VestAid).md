Vestibular Rehabilitation Aid (VestAid)
=======================================

# Abstract


Service members exposed to blasts have frequent complaints of dizziness Appropriate treatment is critical for many reasons: Service members with complaints of dizziness and imbalance are often unable to perform their duties.This results in slower reaction times, decreased productivity (in the form of lost duty days) and negatively impacts force readiness.An integral part of vestibular rehabilitation is an individualized home exercise program that the clinician prescribes to address the patients particular functional limitations and impairments. However, providing patient-compliant home-program vestibular rehabilitation exercises is challenging, because of the difficulty of correctly understanding and following the instructions, lack of motivation, lack of feedback, and other adherence issues.To address this critical need Intelligent Automation, Inc., along with Professor Susan Whitney, propose to develop VestAid, an end-to-end Vestibular Rehabilitation support solution that based on physical therapists directives sets and monitors customized home-program vestibular rehabilitation exercises, and engages patients in adaptive rehab strategies to overcome dizziness and vertigo.VestAid uses a combination of IAIs novel image processing and machine learning algorithms, and individualized mobile health technology to develop an easy-to-operate mobile platform that encourages increasing adherence to treatment programs on the patient side and easy-to-interpret patient-compliance reports on the clinician side.
