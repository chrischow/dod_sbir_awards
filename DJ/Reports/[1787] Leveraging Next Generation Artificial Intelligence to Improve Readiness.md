# Abstract


Malum Terminus Technologies, Inc. AFX20D-TCSO1-0393 Leveraging Next Generation Artificial Intelligence to Improve Readiness Malum Terminus Technologies, Inc. (MTTI) is an artificial intelligence (AI) startup exclusively licensing IP developed by the Iowa Technology Institute (ITI) under a 3 year ONR Code 30 effort that demonstrated success predicting athletes’ musculoskeletal injuries (MSK-I) and the causal factors leading to those injuries.   Patent-pending technical advancements enabled latent predecessors to an injury to be discovered and dynamically quantified given the AI engine’s unique abilities with highly disparate data.  MTTI has used these advances to analyze ground operator injury data - successfully predicting who would get injured, when, and why.  Given high-incidences of lower back & neck injury, USAF pilot data will be analyzed to discover the causal factors associated with these injuries.  PhD-level & human performance experts will: Predict pilot injury risk & when they are likely to be injured Reveal which causal variables matter, in what order or combination Create “What-if” scenario planning capabilities to quantify potential interventions MTTI will partner with the ITI and Titus Human Performance to do so and future phases will validate findings with Luke Air Force Base pilots. MTTI will commercialize the capabilities progressed through this effort in military, government, and private sectors.  Additional applications beyond injury are also being explored.
