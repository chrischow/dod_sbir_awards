# Abstract


WANLYNX Cobalt Guardian provides the technical aggregate of cybersecurity threat data to meet the growing demands of USAF Computer Network Defense (CND) and its Mission Defense Teams (MDT). Integrating with Commercial Cloud Services (C2S), the Cobalt Guardian project utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to minimize false positives and non-malicious alerts and responding to mid-level threats without human interaction. By embracing security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) methodologies we allow our cyber operators to grow their skills, maximize their efficiencies, and minimize the potential burnout associated with the continuous assault of cyber information overload. As described in Joint Publication 3-12; the offensive cyberspace operations (OCO) and defensive cyberspace operations (DCO) experience of the developers is as much as part of WANLYNX as is the Cobalt Guardian capability itself. A tool for cyber operators, built by cyber operators while at the same time, able to inform Commanders decision making process based on semi-real time Cybersecurity information directly applied to their Information System.
