Advanced Combat Simulation for More Effective Anti-Terrorist Operations
=======================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal is for the development of an architecture for asymmetric and anti-terrorist simulations and the application of that architecture in the design and development of multiple user-friendly, PC-based, artificially intelligent asymmetric combat simulation systems.  This effort will utilize a number of existing, mature computer wargames and will focus on enhancements to those game systems using the design architecture to arrive at tools useful not only to the military but also having significant commercial applicability.  The approach will leverage existing development by this project team in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and asymmetric combat simulation.
