Autonomous optical sensor-based identification and tracking system for rogue sUAS (drones)
==========================================================================================

# Abstract


Tarsier’s autonomous optical sensor-based identification and tracking system ("Tarsier AirScout") for rogue small unmanned aerial systems (“sUAS” or Group 1 and Group 2 “drones,” weighing < 55 lbs.) is an artificial intelligence-powered system that autonomously identifies and tracks rogue sUAS. Tarsier aims to provide automated, accelerated, and reliable positive identification of rogue sUAS to augment USAF operators by identifying sUAS targets more accurately and more quickly, enhancing situational awareness, shortening the decision cycle, reducing operator burden, minimizing operator fatigue and error, and improving force protection. The proposed trial includes demonstrating and testing the modified non-defense commercial version of Tarsier AirScout in the Air Force operational environment for committed end users, the 90th Missile Wing’s Security Support Squadron (“90 SSPTS”) and PEO Digital ("AFLCMC/HBUC"). The effort's objectives include: i) obtaining USAF requirements and demonstrating  efficacy of Tarsier's non-defense commercial version for end users; ii) gathering feedback and conducting non-recurring engineering ("NRE") to adapt Tarsier’s non-defense commercial version; and iii) performing demonstrations incorporating the NRE adaptations for committed end users, 90 SSPTS and AFLCMC/HBUC.
