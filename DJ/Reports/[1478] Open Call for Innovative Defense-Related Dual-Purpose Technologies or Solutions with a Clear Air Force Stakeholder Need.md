# Abstract


Every year, the Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars identifying, funding and fielding innovative solutions to meet the needs and challenges facing the warfighter in todayâ€™s modern battlefield. To remain competitive, it is essential that military stakeholders have visibility into the capabilities within this broad innovation portfolio and have the ability to leverage and integrate these capabilities force-wide as quickly as possible. SHELDON leverages advanced data analytics, publicly available datasets and visualizations to enhance military stakeholdersâ€™ understanding of funding in key areas of interest and match mission-tested innovators with prospective federal customers.
