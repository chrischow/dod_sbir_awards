# Abstract


Raven Black provides data infrastructure, machine learning, and software development for defense. The core of Raven Black's capabilities is Three-Eyed Raven (3ER), built by parent company Raven[Ops] for use in autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics. These devices produce terabytes of complex data per hour and quickly overwhelm traditional data systems. The data is often unstructured, making it difficult to search, organize, and analyze. 3ER provides a highly scalable, data source agnostic solution for these challenges. By leveraging 3ER, Raven Black can quickly ingest vast datasets, examine them for useful patterns, and produce vertical applications. This objective of this Phase I effort will be to find opportunities to apply 3ER to the Rapid Sustainment Focus Area. Predicting equipment condition, optimizing maintenance actions, and understanding the impact of operations will require cross-domain datasets. The best solution may require combining everything from time-series aircraft telemetry data, historical maintenance logs, and textual post-mission reports. The first step is to aggregate all of that data, which is where 3ER excels. A Phase II effort will consist of conducting exploratory data analysis on those data sources to find actionable insights. In Phase III, 3ER provides an ideal framework for deploying those results at scale.
