Finding More Threats, Faster with Anno.Ai
=========================================

# Abstract


US civilian agencies and military departments commit an incalculable amount of resources to provide analysts and support elements with the data they need to accomplish Mission tasks. In many instances, ensuring the security and continuity of the data entails untold risks and comes at a high cost of human capital. And while the USG and DoD continues to evolve on the data collection aspect of the Mission -- improving personal safety, data integrity, and collection efficiency -- new challenges have emerged on the other side of the Mission coin... Today’s analysts, targeters and subject matter experts (SMEs) are overwhelmed by the evolution which has occurred in the collection process as petabytes of unstructured data in various formats flow in daily from multi-domain sources. The ability to thoroughly analyze all of the data is constrained by limited technological capabilities and available man-hours. The end result is inefficient analysis and an inability to quickly identify threats, targets and other objects of interest within the collected data. Further, the current state means vast amounts of collected data are never analyzed, and instead, the data is eventually stored in various .zip files in random folders which are unsearchable in Headquarters databases. This leaves the risks and cost of human capital -- incurred by Warfighters, operators, and other collectors -- all for naught. Anno.Ai is founded by former Intelligence Community (IC) officers who spent careers across the globe collecting and analyzing data. These officers have worked extensively with CIA, NGA, JSOC, USAF, SOCOM and other DoD elements. The Anno.Ai team has lived the Mission and has an innate understanding of the need to maintain tactical advantages over US adversaries. Anno.Ai was created specifically to solve hard data problems via machine learning (ML) solutions and an easy-to-use ML application. Anno.Ai’s application provides end-to-end automation of digital media processing workflows so all collected data can be exploited efficiently to affect mission success. The application enables automated discovery of operationally relevant objects in vast amounts of unstructured data so analysts, targeters and operators can focus on the work humans are meant to do -- make sense of the information to inform decisions in order to carry out the Mission.
