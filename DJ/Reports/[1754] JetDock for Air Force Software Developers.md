JetDock for Air Force Software Developers
=========================================

# Abstract


JetDock is a secure DevSecOps portal providing a one-stop-shop for continuous updates, security scans, and deployments of Docker and Kubernetes based containers. It leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), smart agents, and a command line interface (CLI) and chat bot to increase a team’s capability to rapidly deploy applications for projects or programs. With ease, a user can pull down the latest version of a piece of software (i.e. Jira), run security scans, tests, and deploy it into an environment of their choice.
