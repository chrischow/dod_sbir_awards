Database for the storage of Emission Spectra with spectral analysis by Machine Learning (DESML)
===============================================================================================

# Abstract


ABSTRACT:The electromagnetic radiation emitted during the deflagration or detonation of energetic material provides a unique signature specific to the chemical composition of the material. Currently, analysis of complex UV/VIS/NIR emission spectral data of the explosion or deflagration of explosive material is done manually. ChromoLogic proposes to develop a software application capable of processing and identifying the chemical species present in spectroscopic data in real time.BENEFIT:The proposed software application has commercial applications in academic and industrial research settings to automate the processing of spectral data. The application also has national security, forensic, and law enforcement commercial applications for use in the real-time classification of explosive material.
