The Power of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to Radically Improve the Quality of Permanent Change-of-Status Moves
=============================================================================================================================

# Abstract


We propose applying Yemboâ€™s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform to make the process of permanent change-of-station moves for Air Force members and other military members into a stress-free and transparent process. Yemboâ€™s SaaS product uses advanced Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision technology to create an accurate pre-move survey of the consumersâ€™ home from smartphone videos and enables collaboration between the consumer, the moving company representatives and the moving crew. It simultaneously improves the end user experience and move quality for consumers who are moving by driving transparency and traceability through the move process. We are seeing extensive adoption for civilian moves and want to bring the advances to military moves.
