A machine learning platform to extract relevant information quickly from unstructured documents.
================================================================================================

# Abstract


iQC, a machine learning platform, can be easily and quickly trained by subject matter experts (SMEs) through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to extract relevant data from large quantities of unstructured documents and text files or streams. Intelligence analysts, for example, can utilize iQC to process hundreds of thousands of unstructured documents, text files, and data streams, in any language, quickly and thoroughly, allowing them to perform their analyses rapidly on larger sets of data. iQC is being utilized already by data managers in major oil and gas companies to extract data relevant to them from 60,000 documents such as PDFs, images, text files and MS Office documents.
