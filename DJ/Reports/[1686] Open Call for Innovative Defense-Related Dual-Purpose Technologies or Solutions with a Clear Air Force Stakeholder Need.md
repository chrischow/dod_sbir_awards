# Abstract


Jove Sciences, Inc. (JOVE) has just completed an Air Force Research Laboratory Phase II SBIR to improve the performance of the MQ-9 Maritime Wide area Surveillance (MWAS) system by having the MQ-9 Lynx SAR, Full Motion Video, and ISAR Video sensor data transmitted from the ground Control Station (GCS) to JOVEâ€™s Advanced Correlator-Navy (ACOR-N) data fusion processor at the Naval Information Warfare Center-Pacific (NIWC-PAC) at TRl-8 after extremely successful results in five Trident Warrior Exercises. Currently, the MQ-9 MWAS performance in the maritime domain is severely degraded by the Lynx SAR producing far too many ambiguous tracks, and total lack of ship or submarine classification and identification required by the warfighter in the MQ-9 Ground Control Station (GCS), especially on cloudy days when the FMV sensor is not useful. An integrated MQ-9/MWAS/ACOR-N system is being proposed for transition to the MQ-9 Program office (Mr. Lawrence Knight, Mr. Kyle Shelton, and others) to improve the current MQ-9/MWAS performance issues. JOVE proposes here to use Spire Globalâ€™s (SPIREâ€™s) commercially successful worldwide weather and AIS (WW&AIS) ship track capability as inputs to a Knowledge Based Inductive Learning (KBIL) Artificial Intelligent Trusted Agent. One KBIL is assigned to each ship in the world to
