Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The US Air Force relies on a global supply chain that is increasingly commercial, and thus continuously subject to foreign influence as evidenced by the Chinese Supermicro hack. Foreign influence on the vendors serving the US Air Force is a persistent and high-risk challenge that can only be addressed through continuous monitoring. However, the current process for supply chain illumination relies heavily on tedious manual research and is not standardized across the Air Force. A robust supply chain risk illumination solution must be able to harness a vast amount of global commercial data while providing outputs that are meaningful and easy for users to interpret within the context of the DoD supply chain. 202 Group will deliver an integrated data analytics solution to identify a foreign association of vendors in the Air Force supply chain. Our solution combines 202 Groupâ€™s commercially proven database and automated data pipeline processes with two powerful venture-funded artificial intelligence (AI) software platforms. Together, our team brings a deep understanding of DoD procurement and supply chain data, hard to access foreign government open data, vast commercial data sources in any language (e.g., LexisNexus, ThompsonReuters), and leading AI technologies.
