Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Forward 2030 enhances readiness for potential recruits, Airmen and families; by leveraging community-focused, goal-based fitness challenges; maintaining personal fitness and connected communities.â€¯ A successful AF pro-bono program delivered a fun, easy to use â€œSoftware as a Serviceâ€ (SaaS) application. In 2016 USCENTCOM AFLEM participated, followed by the 480th ISR Wingâ€™s geographically dispersed Groups, with 520+ Airmen topping 62,000 miles of physical activity. Based on proven pro bono results, we will adopt the program to further support AF; with input from resiliency teams and recruiters. Resulting in a AF/DoD-Specific SaaS performance readiness platform in support of prospective recruits, Airmen, and families to monitor, manage and share fitness and wellness goals with their support communities worldwide.â€¯ Forward 2030 will leverage AI, big data and machine learning, gamification and behavioral research, for positive personalized engagements and dynamic group interactions; including interoperability for ease of implementation.â€¯ Delivering virtual, anytime, anywhere support for individual Airmen, their Squadron, Group, and Wing; and their families and communities to further readiness and resiliency for the Air Force and potentially, all Service Branches to follow.â€¯ Given current commercialization results, TRL 7, Forward 2030, shows great potential for positive impacts within AF, while delivering a commercially sustainable program.
