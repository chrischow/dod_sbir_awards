# Abstract


There has been recent excitement in the metals manufacturing community converging around a new approach to fabricating low volume â€“ high mix metal parts without the use of tooling, coined â€œMetamorphic Manufacturingâ€. This new approach links Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), machine learning, robotics, and forging, that together open up the ability to produce custom, short run, precision forgings directly from CAD to part without the delay of machining custom closed dies or requiring the use of large, expensive, limited accessibility forging presses. Colloquially this approach is known as â€œRobotic Blacksmithingâ€. In practice, the manufacturing cell includes a robot manipulating a hot piece of metal under an open die forge or hammer press, then using the ICME, machine learning, and in process monitoring, the system adjusts the thermal and strain profiles while optimizing the final part geometry within specifications to produce a final part. 4D Forge LLC is an economically disadvantaged, woman owned, small business (EDWOSB) focused on commercializing Robotic Blacksmithing. This scope of work includes collaboration with Colorado School of Mines to define specific, targeted Air Force applications for the implementation of this revolutionary part manufacturing technology.
