Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


LVL Technologies, Inc. is an advanced machine-learning-based biosensor company that has created the first ever wearable hydration monitor that tracks 24/7 hydration status, automatically detecting changes in hydration state, alerting to potential dangers, providing personalized drink needs, and automatically logging drinks. The LVL platform utilizes a sensor-fusion method to monitor multiple data streams simultaneously - combining physiological, biomechanical, and environmental information. This patented approach allows LVL to track water changes in the body and how it effects the performance of various body systems in response. By monitoring the conditions that produce these changes in the end user, we can then accurately predict hydration needs and potential dangerous situations before they ever occur, reducing the incidence of dehydration related illnesses before they become a danger to the individual.
