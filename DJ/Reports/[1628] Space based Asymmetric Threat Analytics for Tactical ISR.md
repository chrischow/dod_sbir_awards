Space based Asymmetric Threat Analytics for Tactical ISR
========================================================

# Abstract


AFRL/RVSU – ISR Technology Branch and Mission Lead’s Office, and AFRL/RVEN - Small Satellite Portfolio Program, have national defense-related mission needs in the area of MSMU (Multiple Satellite Multiple Use) Analytics. Specifically, the use of Unclassified Geospatial Intelligence Analytics contributing towards Tactical ISR for the warfighter. We believe technology development under the subject SBIR topic may eventually contribute to solving a mission need. The main goals of our involvement in this project are integrating geospatial data from SAR satellites and ascertaining nontraditional asymmetric threats in the battle-space. The mission impact of this project on the US Air Force, the Department of Defense and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency will be a marked improvement towards enhancing the ISR-PED time cycle. Specifically this Phase II effort will integrate Geo-spatial and Non-spatial data collections across global littorals and the maritime domain from Radar (SAR) and Maritime AIS Satellite sensors; apply automated threat analytics using embedded domain intelligence to ascertain non-traditional asymmetric threats with contextual analytics within 500 miles of SAR targets thus providing an extended Situational Awareness picture. The Unclassified Intelligence Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) threat analytics data layer will be made available post analytics via an API to AFRL/RVEN Small Satellite Portfolio in support of RIMPAC 2020 (the world’s largest maritime exercise) in the INDOPACOM area of responsibility with 40 coalition partners. The data analytics shall also be published to the Unified Data Library an AFRL, SMC and US Space Command combined effort. The Unclassified Computer Assisted Threat Analytics (CATE) technology will improve the PED cycle addressing emerging non-traditional asymmetric threats that are obfuscating the battle space e.g. weaponized fishing boats. This will improve tipping and cuing for the warfighter to ensure success in the battle space and in executing their mission. The project will leverage data from multiple satellites to establish capture scenes that validate the targets transit, activities, contextual analytics and proximity to nefarious state and non-state actors. This effort will also validate the value in the advancement of cross tipping between space sensors to help address Tactical ISR using multiple Low Earth Orbits sensors.
