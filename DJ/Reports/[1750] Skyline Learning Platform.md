Skyline Learning Platform
=========================

# Abstract


Recent innovations in Cloud computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) have allowed Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications to be commonplace in our daily lives. Online shopping platforms utilize machine learning recommendation engines to provide custom buying experiences and product discovery recommendations based on historical consumer data. These same technologies can be utilized to tailor, accelerate, and improve how we train our forces. For the past six months, Intrinsic has been working directly with Instructor Pilots and Schedulers at Randolph Air Force Base to apply this technology to their data. Individualized and tailored learning is the next step in applying ML, and Intrinsic proposes the continued use of ML best practices, Pilot Training Next (PTN) historical data, and our Skyline Learning Platform to automate pilot training and scheduling. The system incorporates student gradesheet and maneuver scores to automatically recommend the next set of events the student should train on, greatly improving on the current paper processes and practices used today.
