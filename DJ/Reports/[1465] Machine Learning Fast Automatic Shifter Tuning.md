Machine Learning Fast Automatic Shifter Tuning
==============================================

# Abstract


To address the Air Force need for an improved thermal characterization process for ferrite phase shifters used in phased array antennas, Physical Optics Corporation (POC), proposes to develop a Machine-Learning Fast Automatic Shifter Tuning (M-FAST) system. The current method to characterize ferrite phase shifters used in phased array antennas during the overhaul process at OC-ALC requires a minimum of 16 hours. Innovation in the M-FAST measurement process reduces the M-FAST characterization time to
