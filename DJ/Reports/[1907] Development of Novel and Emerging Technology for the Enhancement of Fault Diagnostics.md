Development of Novel and Emerging Technology for the Enhancement of Fault Diagnostics
=====================================================================================

# Abstract


Diagnosing complex problems with critical submarine equipment like the Electrostatically Supported Gyro Navigator (ESGN) Stable Platform and Housing (SP&H) is difficult. Vast quantity of information is available (from Field Engineer Information Management System FEIMS and Level II Manuals) that can be mined and smart diagnostics, prognostics and machine learning algorithms can be developed to solve the problems in the most efficient way. Intelligent Automation, Inc., along with Boeing Corporation, Integrated Shipboard Systems (ISS), plans to develop the Adaptive Prognostics Tool (APT) system. IAIs APT will adhere to Naval Open Architecture guidelines and improve maintenance efficiency by presenting accurate and concise troubleshooting recommendations based on text mining historical data of faults and available resources. APT will employ a Dynamic Case-Based Reasoning (DCBR) approach, which is a powerful technique for Fault Diagnosis and Prognosis. DCBR allows the accumulation of experience from inclusion of the new cases and therefore accommodates learning. APT is a self-learning, adaptive software tool primarily designed for field engineers and Nav ETs to quickly diagnose and provide pertinent repair recommendations. APT will increase mission readiness while at the same time reducing Total Ownership Costs (TOC).
