F16 Maintenance Analytics 149th Fighter Wing
============================================

# Abstract


A rapidly growing China and resurgent Russia aim to coerce their regional neighbors, undermine long-standing alliances, and displace America’s influence from critical regions around the globe.  These powers are challenging U.S. dominance in all warfighting domains: air, land, sea, space, cyberspace. The globalization of technology now allows access to technology research and talent at a fraction of past costs. Technology parity is a near term challenge that threatens the U.S as the leader in all warfighting domains. The JAIC vision is to Transform the DOD through Artificial Intelligence. One of the pillars of the JAIC is Implementing Predictive Maintenance and Supply. The goal is to predict more accurately maintenance needs on assets improving availability and reducing cost. The following Technical Volume will describe our Phase II holistic approach to Predictive/Prescriptive Maintenance and supply chain management wherein we first structure IMDS and the F16 Maintenance Manuals for near real-time analysis of the IMDS maintenance database. Secondly, is to create recommendations to the Flightline maintenance personal on the most corrective action for a T.O. while simultaneously informing them of current supply levels.
