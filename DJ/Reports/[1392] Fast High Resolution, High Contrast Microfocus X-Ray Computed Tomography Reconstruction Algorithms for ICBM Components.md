Fast High Resolution, High Contrast Microfocus X-Ray Computed Tomography Reconstruction Algorithms for ICBM Components
======================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Nondestructive testing (NDT) with Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is of increasing importance for parts inspection in industrial applications. The Air Force uses CBCT to inspect small components in ICBM systems for a host of different detection tasks. The objective of the proposed work is to develop a robust, user-friendly software product that performs high resolution CBCT reconstructions with automated artifact correction. Building upon the successful prototype developed in Phase I, the proposed software product will incorporate an iterative reconstruction algorithm that will enable high-quality reconstructions with dramatically reduced data acquisition times. It will additionally include sophisticated beam hardening and ring artifact correction algorithms that will be automatically tuned to achieve the best possible image quality in the reconstructions. The utility of the new reconstruction software will be shown on phantom data using a machine learning algorithm to assess the overall improved image quality. At the end of this Phase II contract we will deliver a product level CBCT reconstruction software.
