AI-Enabled Behavior Analysis at the Tactical Edge for Surveillance Cameras
==========================================================================

# Abstract


Gantz-Mountain Intelligence Automation Systems, Inc is a “Small Business” located in Monterey, California that has pioneered smart sensor technology for small unit tactical operations.  Gantz-Mountain has pioneered Artificial Intelligence enabled Behavior Analysis at the tactical edge. Gantz-Mountain has developed a proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) System of Systems IAS that outperforms neural networks and does not require the "obscene amount of training data" like neural networks do. It is scene independent can be fielded anywhere, for object detection, feature extraction, symbol formation, behavior analysis implemented across our products at the edge.  These products are software upgradable with more AI behaviors, symbols, features, objects, and behaviors over time.  Not only do our systems detect and classify people, vehicle, bags, it has smart object tracking and behavior analysis.  We completed an effort with USG Clients for behaviors at the edge (such has bag handoffs, and a dozen more behaviors).  Currently, we are implementing Client specific behaviors, include adding detection of long guns, RPGs, people in truck beds, gun mount in trucks, etc. for SOF specific behaviors (e.g., IED placement, loading/unloading bags, truck with people in specific trails, person with RPG on trail, etc.). Tactical units lack a real-time intelligence automation capability for surveillance and force protection applications. Focus Area 15.1 (Sensors – Collaborative, Multi-Domain, Instrumented, Distributed, and AI-Ready) is seeking commercial innovation to improve collaborative and distributive sensing capabilities that can contribute to a scalable, open architecture, sensing enterprise that provides sensing at extended ranges. To meet this requirement, Gantz-Mountain Intelligence Automation Systems, Inc. will leverage its existing turn-key tactical surveillance system with artificial intelligence (AI) enabled behavior analysis for real-time alerts at the tactical edge. Gantz-Mountain Intelligence Automation Systems’ revolutionary technology establishes the future standard in smart expeditionary surveillance capability with a turn-key tactical surveillance system featuring ruggedized, low-visibility, unattended, smart ground sensors with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled threat intent determination at the tactical edge.  This easy to deploy technology forms a network of electronic observation and listening posts providing tremendous force multiplication, manpower and bandwidth savings while reducing the cognitive load on operators during rural and urban surveillance along with force protection applications.  This technology has been packaged under sponsorship from OSD, CTTSO, USSOCOM, USASOC, FBI, CBP and DHS S&T. The MT-5-R/MT-5-FSIS is currently being procured by Army Tactical Units and ARSOF in support of contingency operation via the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force (REF).
