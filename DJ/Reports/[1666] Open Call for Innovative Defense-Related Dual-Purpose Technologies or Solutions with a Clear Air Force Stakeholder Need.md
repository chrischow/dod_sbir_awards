Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Havikâ€™s proposes to introduce a commercially viable portable VR training simulator, Joint Fires Trainer (JFT)for the JTAC community. JFT is a drastic improvement from the existing training simulators currently on the market. JFTâ€™s system is portable, more immersive, provides a higher fidelity of realism and is built off COTS hardware that will be improving year after year. The Air Force customer will no longer be stuck with needing a dedicated infrastructure, expensive equipment, and lack of systems to benefit the force. These mobile VR simulators are affordable enough that every unit can have their own if not possibly every Air Force JTAC could potentially have their own. New age data analytics can provide user feedback down to a micro scale and allow users to know exactly where they need to improve. Personalized training scenarios will be created for each individual Air Force JTAC based on their current progression. Standardized baselines can be formed that will give the Air Force the most accurate information about its soldiers. The Air Force will not only save 10x in cost per unit but produce a 10x better soldier.
