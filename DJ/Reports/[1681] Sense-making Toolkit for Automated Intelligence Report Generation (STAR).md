Sense-making Toolkit for Automated Intelligence Report Generation (STAR)
========================================================================

# Abstract


The proposed Phase II project will enhance, re-purpose, evaluate, and harden a ‘Sense-making Toolkit for Automated Intelligence Report Generation (STAR)’ to extend the current state of the art in automated intelligence report generation for intelligence analysis. The resulting STAR - IPM™ capability enhancement will enable improved Intelligence report generation through information fusion from multi-source, multi-modal data (including text and images) to produce enhanced situational awareness for decision making.  The Phase II project will establish application requirements, enhance the architecture, configure and demonstrate the technology application, evaluate and validate the technology, and refine and harden the technology for accelerated Air Force transition and large scale commercial application.  STAR uses a unique approach for combining ontology-driven semantic multi-source information processing, information fusion, data analytics, and automated product generation.
