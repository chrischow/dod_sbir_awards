Enhanced Pilot Training Readiness using Enriched Biometric Data: Breathing and Motion Data using Wearable Sensors
=================================================================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force requires the continuous training and development of pilots to maintain combat readiness over a variety of aircraft types. Assessment of pilot development and readiness during training involves various performance metrics as well as biometrics, which currently includes eye tracking. However, we believe further biometric assessments in real time can aid instructors and artificial intelligence-based adaptive learning platforms in better predictive assessment of pilots and faster training. Zansors has developed the next-generation wearable breathing sensor that can provide enriched biometric data on breathing patterns and movement, with current validated applications to sleep quality and athletic performance. We propose a proof-of-concept application of Zansors wearable technology to enhance and improve pilot training and performance assessment. Our technology, designed and manufactured in the USA, can enhance individual assessments through breathing and movement patterns during different training situations to assess and provide biofeedback, and help quicken and improve the pilot training process.
