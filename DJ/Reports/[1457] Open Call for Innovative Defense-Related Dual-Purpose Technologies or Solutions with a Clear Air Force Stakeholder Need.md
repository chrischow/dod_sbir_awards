Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Parallel Domain is accelerating the development of artificial intelligence for autonomous systems. Our mission is to help our customers deploy a broad range of autonomous systems faster, more safely, and for a fraction of the cost compared to current approaches. Our technology automatically generates massive simulation worlds where itâ€™s safe to learn from mistakes. These environments are used to expose autonomous systems to the millions of miles and scenarios that they must encounter during development, training, and testing. Real-world training at this scale is not only prohibitively slow and expensive, it can be extremely dangerous. For systems that need to deploy in locations with limited access or hypothetical scenarios, real-world data may be impossible to obtain. We currently offer a range of products from pre-configured virtual environments up to enterprise software solutions for generating new virtual worlds on the fly. Most of our customers are consumer automotive companies building a full-stack autonomous vehicle effort. These customers are traditionally focused on simulation in developed areas across the United States, but Parallel Domain can work with defense and government customers to simulate rural areas or other geographic locations.
