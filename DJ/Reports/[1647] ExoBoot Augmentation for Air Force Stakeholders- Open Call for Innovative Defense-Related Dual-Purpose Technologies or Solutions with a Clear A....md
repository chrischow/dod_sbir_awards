ExoBoot Augmentation for Air Force Stakeholders- Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
=====================================================================================================================================================================

# Abstract


In 2014, MIT researchers (now Dephy co-founders) developed and published the first autonomous device to improve walking efficiency. Since then, Dephyâ€™s ExoBoot system has been shown to reduce metabolic consumption, increase speed, and mitigate load carriage. User testing has confirmed that the ExoBoot is comfortable to wear, easy to don/doff and requires no training. Onboard artificial intelligence (AI) quickly adapts to each userâ€™s unique walking patterns and feels like a normal boot when unpowered.
