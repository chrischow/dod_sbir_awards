Real Time Low Cost Tracking of Air Force Assets- Global Strike Command and Others
=================================================================================

# Abstract


The Air Force has highlighted a need for asset and equipment position and navigation history capability without the use of GPS, RFID points or other external infrastructure required. Ubihere, a Columbus Ohio based high-technology commercial company, has developed a unique highly capable low-cost localized geo-location hardware and software system to replace or augment GPS tracking for people and assets indoors and outdoors. The technology was developed at The Ohio State University over the last five years with over $2 million of federal funding received from organization like the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, NASA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy. The patented system and method’s uniqueness is that it utilizes on-board machine learning software to accurately track assets or people in real-time with or without GPS. This solution is applicable to any Air Force equipment, asset or personnel tracking needs, but will be developed and tested in conjunction with the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess AFB who defined their problem as; "“All Aerospace Ground Equipment dispatches/movements are required to be tracked in order to accurately recall which assets came in contact with each aircraft in case of a maintenance issue." This project solves their challenge. This project also results in a field ready solution which can be deployed across many other applications in the Air Force.  From tracking Airman on the battlefield to equipment in the hanger, this solution would address the common need of real-time low-cost tracking.
