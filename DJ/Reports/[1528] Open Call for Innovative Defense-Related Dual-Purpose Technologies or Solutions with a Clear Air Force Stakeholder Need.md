Open Call for Innovative Defense-Related Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions with a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need
====================================================================================================================

# Abstract


Cloverleaf uses behavioral assessments, big data and machine learning to identify patterns and anomalies in specific career fields (AFSC codes). This data would then allow the Air Force to identify gaps in potential recruits to vector talent management resources to fill in those gaps, strengthening the individuals, teams, and leaders to create a stronger overall Air Force.
