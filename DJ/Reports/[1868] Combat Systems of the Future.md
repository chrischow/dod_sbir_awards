Combat Systems of the Future
============================

# Abstract


The objective of this Phase II effort is to develop a prototype command and control system (Combat System of the Future) and associated concept of operations with the goals of improved automation, reduced manning and improved performance over current combat systems. This will be accomplished through the analysis of selected missions, first defining the specific decisions that must be made to accomplish the missions and then identifying the tasks, data and information required to make the decisions. Based on this analysis a scalable functional design will be developed and technologies such as artificial intelligence identified to implement specific functions within the design. Special attention will be given to human system integration. Finally, a combat system of the future data fusion prototype will be developed and tested with both simulated and at sea data (if available) to evaluate the performance improvement afforded by the new technology.
