# Abstract


Chooch has built a new generation of combined neural networks for visual recognition. This new generation of networks makes AI scalable and more accessible to companies and people. Chooch solved for training and predictions bottlenecks in AI by integrating different types of deep learning frameworks, models, classes, and neural nets. The current problem in artificial intelligence is related to both the training and prediction aspects of AI systems. Chooch has solved for the bottlenecks by devising a network on top and between the neural networks, creating a dynamic hierarchy of models and sub-networks. Choochâ€™s proprietary IP is crucial for the scaling of any and all artificial intelligence related solutions. Chooch currently has 112,000 classes trained in 88 models.
