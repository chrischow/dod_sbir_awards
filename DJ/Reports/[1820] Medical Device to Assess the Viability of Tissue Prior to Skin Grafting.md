Medical Device to Assess the Viability of Tissue Prior to Skin Grafting
=======================================================================

# Abstract


The primary objective of this Phase II proposal is to construct and validate the portable SpectralMD DeepView imaging technology designed previously in Phase I. This device allows surgeons to quickly and objectively assess tissue viability in burn surgery prior to skin grafting. DeepView uses machine learning and multispectral imaging to generate quantitative prognostic images with easily interpretable and user-friendly outputs. It is to our knowledge the only burn imaging technology that has undergone thorough investigation in a pre-clinical animal model of burn excision, where it demonstrated success in detecting tissue viability throughout the skin layers and into the subcutaneous fat. Upon completion of Phase II, a complete system will be built and validated to provide images of the post-excisional remaining tissues in real-time to aid surgeons in determining if and how much burn tissue to excise. Other uses of the portable DeepView device include: diagnosing burn wound healing potential and the need for surgery during in burn triage; and monitoring of reconstructive flap viability. The portable DeepView system will have wide commercial utility in addition to the current military-focused application.
