# Abstract


The FX-BLOX is a dual-use modification of the revolutionary FabricXpress edge computing product line, originally conceived during a skunkworks effort with Intel Corp in 2014-2015. FabricXpress exploits a novel PCIe-switching technique creating a â€œsuper-highwayâ€ bus architecture that dramatically increases storage capacity and processing speeds involving high volume/velocity data to enable real-time decisions from advanced analytics, at the point of ingest. The first commercial product, FX-1000, was launched in 2017 and is in use by several companies in both the commercial and defense sectors. Independent testing has shown FabricXpress to be 10-30x faster than any other computing system in its class. The FX-2000 will be released in August 2019 with more than double the number of PCIe lanes, 50% improvement in processing, and more capacity for GPUs. These products are rack-mounted in traditional data centers. Based on demand from several military units for a rapidly deployable FabricXpress system, the FX-BLOX effort for this SBIR involves modifying the design into a ruggedized carry-on suitcase and reconfiguring the components to be modular to meet a wide range of tactical edge and hybrid cloud missions including but not limited to, cybersecurity network monitoring, sensor/imagery analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
