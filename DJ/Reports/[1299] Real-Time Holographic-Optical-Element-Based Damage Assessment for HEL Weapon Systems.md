Real-Time Holographic-Optical-Element-Based Damage Assessment for HEL Weapon Systems
====================================================================================

# Abstract


To address the Air Force need for a target damage/kill assessment sensor for high-energy laser (HEL) weapon systems, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) is developing a Holographic-Optical-Element-Based Damage Assessment (HOEDA) system. Based on sensor and data fusion of three laser remote-sensing (polarimetry, vibrometry, and spectroscopy) modules, HOEDA is based on optics of a single telescope using innovative holographic optics and physics-based software models (algorithms). The system provides accurate and reliable damage assessment (from predamage to kill) in targets hit by HEL weapon systems. While operating at standoff distances of up to 200 km from military aircraft at altitudes >25,000 feet, the system offers submillisecond response (real time) to provide feedback for lethal/less-lethal operation of both strategic and tactical HEL systems.  In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the HOEDA system by modeling and simulations and by assembling and laboratory testing a TRL-4 prototype using simulated damaged targets. In Phase II, POC plans to assemble an optimized, fully functional, low power consuming
