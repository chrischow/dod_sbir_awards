oVio--Revolutionary Identity Management
=======================================

# Abstract


oVio develops innovative technologies in identification, imaging, and enrollment. This patented technology captures 360-degree high-resolution, perfectly centered images, transcoded in real time into a single video file, which can be extracted and viewed individually, allowing for degree by degree, side by side comparisons. All images can be integrated with advanced facial recognition and morphology software. Images can be stored locally or remotely, via the cloud or hybrid cloud solution; and exported as video, stills, or a 3D file.  The oVio360™ technology stack is a state-of-the-art, interactive imaging capability, integrated within a proprietary hardware/software ecosystem. The patented SubjectView360™ centering and imaging method and comprehensive software suite manages centering, capture, filing, storage, and indexing. An open-source application programming interface (API) is used for integration with existing databases and systems. The robotic camera movement captures a 360-degree image file in 12 seconds, which is displayed as high quality source imagery such as 360-degree High Definition (HD) still images, which are taggable, indexable, and sharable. In addition, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as facial recognition software, are greatly enhanced by superior image data. Using AI, these Deep Learning (DL) architectures, such as neural networks, will learn to perform better, faster, and with greater accuracy. oVio’s DL-based facial recognition software is combined to deliver an optimized, end-to-end solution for environments demanding wide area surveillance and biometric identification. The technology provides superior recognition capability compared to conventional approaches. The system recognizes individuals from nearly all viewpoints where a minimal portion of the face is visible. Identification is also possible under adverse lighting conditions, from overhead viewpoints, and when the face is obscured by sunglasses or partially concealed. The onboard computer contains 32GB of RAM, 500G of onboard storage and a 1TB expandable Solid-State Drive (SSD) for additional storage. The imaging system is comprised of dual cameras, a 42" centering monitor, fully integrated operator station, and oVio's proprietary software suite. This system, utilizing a global shutter, machine vision camera, captures 360-degree high resolution still images that are transcoded in real time into a 12 second, 360-degree video file. Each still image is encoded with the degree at which the image was taken, and all still are stored and can be exported individually. The still images and videos can be viewed, tagged, edited, and shared securely and privately locally or on a cloud-based solution using any browser or mobile device. The oVio image files are also ideal files for the creation of 3D images. The 3D files can be created without the use of computer-generated (CG) effects and are therefore 100% accurate.
