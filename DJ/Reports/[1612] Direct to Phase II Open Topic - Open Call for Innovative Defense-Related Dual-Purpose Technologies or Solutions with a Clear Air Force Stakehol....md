# Abstract


Apollo is building a cloud-based operating system that enables traditionally manned aircraft to fly unmanned and autonomously in a variety of airspace, and from nearly any airport. Apollo leverages edge computing and artificial intelligence to provide an innovative, software-first approach to aircraft autonomy. Apolloâ€™s technology has substantial commercial application and we are currently beta testing our software in a variety of aircraft. Apollo will partner with AFWERX, AFRL, and NSW to deploy our autonomous flight software to test a pilot in the loop to showcase our technologyâ€™s ability to bridge the manned-to-unmanned acquisitions gap.
