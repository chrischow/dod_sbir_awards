Elevate Government Solutions DLA202-003 Proposal
================================================

# Abstract


As the United States pharmaceutical industry grows more effective and complex, so do the supply chains which support operations. The increased demand for low-cost economics has dispersed the United States pharmaceutical supply chain across the globe. Offsourcing has proved to be a viable cost cutting strategy for pharmaceutical companies, and the trend has seen infrastructure for critical drugs be built overseas. At its core this produces an extreme risk to United States national security and defense readiness. Something that only becomes exacerbated by the recent COVID-19 crisis impacting the nation and world at large. Elevate Government Solutions proposes making use of their deep subject matter expertise in pharmaceutical supply chain management, data science, and technology development to analyze the current state, identify key data points, visualize the data, and shape it for clean consumption by the tool to be developed in Phase II. We will leverage the experience of working with and advising industry leaders in the pharmaceutical space along with industry best practices related to data analytics and technology development. The primary objective of Phase I will be to deliver data points in a shape that is both human readable and easily manipulated for machine consumption in Phase II.
