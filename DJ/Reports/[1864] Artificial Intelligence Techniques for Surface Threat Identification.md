Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Surface Threat Identification
====================================================================

# Abstract


The Intelligent Surface Threat Identification System (ISTIS) is based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.  ISTIS will automatically analyze the data associated with a track, hypothesize, draw inferences, and make ID related recommendations.  These data include the tracks’ location and/or velocity reported over time and other ID related reports such as IFF codes, visual ID reports, acoustic signature, specific emitter ID (SEI), ELINT signature, FLIR reports, intelligence reports, communications, etc. The ultimate goal of this effort is to improve the ID process, quality, and efficiency.  This improved performance includes better use of scarce ID resources, better ID estimations from available information, sooner ID determinations, prevention of ID “surprises”, and operating successfully in more complex environments.  ISTIS will demonstrate a significant potential for improved ID performance and reduced LCS ID manning in Phase II.  Other LCS applications and other ship types will also benefit from the techniques.  In Phase II, ISTIS will be integrated with the LCS C&D suite at Lockheed Martin’s Technology Collaboration Center (TCC).
