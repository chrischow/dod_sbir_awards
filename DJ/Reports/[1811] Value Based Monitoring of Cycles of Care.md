Value Based Monitoring of Cycles of Care
========================================

# Abstract


The battle to derive value from twenty-first century healthcare leviathans is just beginning. As the world and its economies become increasingly globalized, the struggle to balance rising costs with access to quality healthcare is not just a problem for the United States and the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS). It is a problem wherever resources are constrained and process and bureaucracy trump relationships between human beings. Therefore, revolutionary and transformative approaches to tailoring and measuring value for each patient given their condition specific cycle of care must be developed. The Real-time Algorithm Technical Environment (RATE) is a new approach for measuring patient centered outcomes. RATE is a comprehensive algorithm analysis platform composed of modules to support data input/output, knowledge representation, model training, algorithm development, and evaluation. The platform will consume data from multiple medical datasets and sources as well as transfer and combine data between machine learning algorithms. RATE will be composed of best of breed data stores and advanced algorithms that can be combined and tailored to continually improve system performance (i.e. learn). The result is a customized measurement platform to assess patient outcomes along three broad categories: better, faster, and more affordable care.
