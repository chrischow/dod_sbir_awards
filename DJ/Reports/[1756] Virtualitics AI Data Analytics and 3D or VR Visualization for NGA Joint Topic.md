Virtualitics AI Data Analytics and 3D/VR Visualization for NGA Joint Topic
==========================================================================

# Abstract


VIP - Virtualitics Immersive Platform®, is an AI-driven data analytics and advanced visualization software product that empowers users, regardless of their background, to quickly find insights from complex multisource data. The embedded AI guides the user in rapidly finding insights in complex data and suggests ways to visualize those insights for optimal human understanding. Our patented technology for 3D visualization enables the user to intuitively visualize the insights in multiple dimensions at the same time (x, y, z, color, size, etc.) and geospatially. The optional VR component also allows the user to effectively communicate those insights to others through our SVO - Shared Virtual Office™ where all parties involved can interact with the data. The data visualizations and collaboration tools available in VR are also available as 3D visualizations on laptops or desktop terminals.
