EF-18 Electronic Combat Automation
==================================

# Abstract


The Network-Centric Warfare/ForceNet mandate that `warriors, sensors, command and control, platforms, and weapons be integrated into a networked, distributed combat force' drives the need to develop a cross-platform integration of Electronic Warfare (EW) assets. This dictate drives the development of an Electronics Combat Decision Support System (ECDSS) to aid flight crews and EW experts in the decision making processes. To provide the real-time response to environmental changes, the GBL Team ECDSS will link proven Artificial Intelligence Technology reasoning `Agents' into a unified system that utilizes expert knowledge in specific domains to augment crew efficiency and involvement in the ForceNet. The ECDSS will enable a single operator to manage and generate jamming assignments and exploit the ability to share response coverage between on and off-board assets. The ECDSS will coordinate mission goals by performing critical timing of asset utilization to exploit jamming techniques that are unworkable without the use of Intelligent agents. The ECDSS agents will monitor environmental cues and provide weapons system coordination by increasing the automation of the time critical task of developing HARM targeting packages.
