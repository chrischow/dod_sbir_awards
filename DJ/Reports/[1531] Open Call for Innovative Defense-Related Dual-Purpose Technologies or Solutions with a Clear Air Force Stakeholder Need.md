# Abstract


Maren-go and our teammate, Sentien, have created Maren-go Battlefield Herd AI Logistics (HAIL); a fundamentally different system that seamlessly brings together diverse digital verticals to outfit remote commanders and individual operators with ISR, logistic, and potentially kinetic capabilities without requiring expensive manned assets, all while enabling machine learning across a continually evolving set of platforms. Routine logistic requirements force deployed elements, like those in Niger in Oct 2017, into predictable rhythms along established lines of communication the enemy is able to exploit. The current state of operations creates the conditions for ambush or exploitation by the enemy often times leaving our operators in a straight gun fight with a numerically superior enemy attacking from advantaged positions. Not only would HAIL provide the logistic distribution capacity to enable warfighters to avoid predictable movements in the area of operations (AO), but our system can provide persistent support to turn a rapidly deteriorating situation into a route of the enemy as ISR, logistic (Class I, V, and VIII), and kinetic applications are autonomously launched from a vehicle in a convoy or from a local patrol base in direct support of warfighter requests. Making every platform an intelligence platform.
