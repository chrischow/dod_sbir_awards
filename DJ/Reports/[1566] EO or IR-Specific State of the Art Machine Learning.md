EO/IR-Specific State of the Art Machine Learning
================================================

# Abstract


Toyon Research Corporation is proposing to develop machine learning algorithms that can perform object classification and detection tasks using low resolution remote sensing imagery. Our approach is to supplement the information contained by low resolution pixels with additional contextual information in a Bayesian neural network framework.
