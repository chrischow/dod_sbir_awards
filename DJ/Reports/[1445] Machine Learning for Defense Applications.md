# Abstract


SparkCognition partnered with SOFWERX to develop an adaptive, artificial intelligence-powered solution to predictive maintenance. The main goal of this solution was to identify major equipment failures across a limited set of historical data provided by SOFWERX. SparkCognition and SOFWERX used aircraft maintenance data and manuals to predict failures of critical systems, with SOFWERX providing the data and validating generated models
