Dynamically Reconfigurable Data Architectures for Aircraft Data Analysis and Anomaly Detection
==============================================================================================

# Abstract


The focus of this SBIR is to create a new data architecture that will allow for ease of reconfiguration and analysis of disparate data sources. For Phase I Latent Knowledge will explore the feasibility of creating this architecture using an experimental artificial intelligence system designed around a conceptual model of the human brain. This system should be able to be used as a simple extension of existing analytical database systems. It will support the analysis of multiple systems through data fusion and data mining.
