Space Radiation Intelligence System (SPRINTS)
=============================================

# Abstract


NextGen Federal Systems proposes an innovative SPace Radiation INTelligence System (SPRINTS) which provides an interactive and web-delivered capability that significantly improves long-range forecasts (2-3 days), all-clear forecasts, and forecast accuracies of solar particle events (SPEs). SPRINTS provides SPE-related data, visualizations, and forecasts that leverage and integrate two complimentary and cutting-edge foundational space weather systems: Magnetogram Forecast (Mag4) and Space Weather Information System (SWIS). The integration of these two capabilities with the addition of an intuitive/interactive user interface and advanced data analysis/forecasting capabilities provides SPRINTS users with the unique ability to effectively explore SPE data and forecasts relevant to their asset(s) and data needs. While leveraging and delivering the forecasts produced by Mag4, the SPRINTS forecast system will use machine-learning and expert-guided statistical analyses to explore new models based, not only on data provided by Mag4 and SWIS, but designed to incorporate other SPE-relevant datasets. SPRINTS also incorporates information about specific space and airborne assets that are entered by individual users and organizations. This information will be integrated with the SPRINTS radiation environment models and engineering models of the predicted impact of SPEs to specific hardware and instruments. SPRINTS serves as a platform to deliver SPE-based operational products covering monitoring, forecasting, and impact analysis of SPEs to help define mission planning, operations, evaluation, and safety.
