Personalized Driving Data for Insurance Discounts &amp; Public Benefits
=======================================================================

# Abstract


This proposal suggests research on developing the next generation of consumer experience for Usage Based Insurance (UBI) in an increasingly socially connected world while addressing the need to protect privacy. It also proposes research on methodologies to address this from the perspective of insurance actuarial science. It will enhance Agnik’s current consumer and UBI products through the following innovations:
a) Collective Incentives and Game Theory: Explore the problem of risk modeling and underwriting from a social perspective using a game theoretic analytical framework in order to design loyalty programs for drivers.
b) Pattern Preserving Encryption: Develop privacy-protecting data analytics algorithms for blending “pattern-preserving cryptography” with data analytics so that driver data can be analyzed without having to access raw privacy-sensitive location or driving data.
c) Reducing Cost and Enhancing the UBI Experience: Analytical results will be integrated with Agnik’s smartphone-based and OBD-II dongle-based solutions with various value-added services. Agnik’s consumer market products are currently sold by companies like Walmart, Amazon, VOXX, and AT&T.

The proposed research will be performed by the Agnik team in collaboration with several insurance carriers such as American Family, General, Plymouth Rock in addition to Agnik’s distribution partners such as VOXX and Sprint (supporting letters enclosed).
