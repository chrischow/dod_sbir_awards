SBIR Phase I: Machine Learning Software for Viral Sequence Analysis and Diagnostics
===================================================================================

# Abstract


This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing computational intelligence tools for viral sequence analysis. In contrast to current modeling approaches, the proposed software tool will result in an easily interpreted best model that can be used to better understand the relationship between sequence variations and phenotypic behavior and or response. The research will result in a user friendly software tool that will allow for better predictability of the effect of viral mutations on infectivity, efficacy of the virus as well as aid in the development of antivirals and effect of treatments.  This has broad application in viral research and pharmaceutical design.
