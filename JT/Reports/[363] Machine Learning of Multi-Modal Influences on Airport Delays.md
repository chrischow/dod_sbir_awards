Machine Learning of Multi-Modal Influences on Airport Delays
============================================================

# Abstract


This SBIR system is a machine learning system that uses a very large database of airside and landside data to predict pushback and takeoff times of aircraft at a given airport.  Airside data sources describe the state of the system after TSA security screening is complete, and includes information about the crew and passengers arriving at the departure gate, turnaround and pushback preparation, ramp and taxiway movement, and aircraft arrival to and departure from the gates.  Landside data sources describe the state of the airport prior to TSA screening, including TSA queue line delays, passenger movement through the airport via cameras, parking availability, road transit delays, congestion, and accidents, and weather conditions. These data are used to classify the current day data using cluster analysis, and take off time and pushback time predictions are made based on the cluster analysis results.
