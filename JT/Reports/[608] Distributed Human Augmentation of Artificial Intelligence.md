Distributed Human Augmentation of Artificial Intelligence
=========================================================

# Abstract


NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This novel model envisions an economy where economic growth can be accelerated without the harmful continual depopulation of America's rural areas in favor of ever more overpopulated urban centers. This will be accomplished by innovative technology, which will access two largely untapped resources, namely the underemployed, but well-educated, rural workforce and the power of a new approach to leading edge artificial intelligence (AI) computer technology. This same approach will also facilitate the fullest possible economic participation of the physically challenged and more senior members of the rural population. This unique approach to artificial intelligence applies in a variety of consumer environments. This business model is one that can be applied immediately to markets with a combined total of more than 100,000 retail outlets. The model will be extended to provide new categories of service in additional industries such as education, health care, hospitality, entertainment, business services and other customer service verticals.
