# Abstract


Agencies, researchers and companies recognize that today’s abundance of sensor and other data offers a great opportunity for better use of energy resources by introducing energy-awareness into algorithms for vehicle control and decision-making. AV-Connect has identified a gap between the broad availability of maps, traffic forecasts, and large streams of vehicle sensor telematics, and the need for energy-aware algorithms that use real-time data to optimize vehicle behavior that can reduce vehicle energy consumption. AV-Connect will combine machine learning algorithms and decision-making algorithms to process real- time data streams from vehicles’ telematics, traffic and weather forecasts, and deliver tailored route and charging recommendations for electrified vehicles. It will target range anxiety by accurately predicting vehicle energy performance and by selecting routes and charging options that minimize energy usage. AV-Connect’s proposed platform addresses the target set by topic 12.C, as it uses real-time data to identify and leverage opportunities for better energy usage, while alleviating a big obstacle to rapid adoption of electrified mobility. In Phase I we focus on EVs and PHEVs for personal transportation; in that space, we identified a technology gap due to the lack of integration between vehicle telematics data, traffic and routing maps. If successful, our platform can also increase the value of electric fleets of light vehicles and delivery robots. In Phase I, AV-Connect will deploy and quantify the impact of a learning-based eco-routing platform for Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs). The platform will consist of IoT software, machine learning algorithms, and decision-making algorithms. It will leverage real-time data streams from vehicles’ telematics, traffic and weather forecasts, and deliver tailored route and charging recommendations. It will target route energy reduction and range anxiety by accurately predicting vehicle behavior and by selecting routes and charging options that minimize energy usage. AV-Connect will use head-to-head road tests to validate the variation of energy consumption and travel time. AV-Connect’s WideSense Eco-Services platform will deliver numerous cloud services to electrified vehicles from high-precision range prediction, eco-routing, eco-cruise control among others. This would enable a more rapid adoption of EVs and improve their energy performance, resulting in dramatic reductions in fuel emissions and GHG through the replacement of gasoline vehicles.
