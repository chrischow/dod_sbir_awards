Frameworks for Semantic Integration of Intelligent Sensor Processing Systems
============================================================================

# Abstract


In the proposed Phase II effort, we will create a new framework and runtime infrastructure for GAI development called the Semantic Integration Framework for Intelligent Systems (SIFIS).  SIFIS will consist of an integrated set of middleware and development tools that enable semantic modeling of component-based GAI systems.  SIFIS will increase development productivity in intelligent systems through increasing reuse, facilitating evolutionary and iterative development.  By providing a basis for reasoning about individual system components and capabilities, the resultant tools and languages will allow rapid analysis, adaptation and reintegration during the course of intelligent systems development. SIFIS will leverage IAIâ€™s Distributed Control Framework (DCF) to enable semantic composition in component-based robotic systems.  The proposed Phase II development effort will pave the way towards a unified knowledge and concept representation across all abstraction and modeling levels, enabling semantic integration of large-scale general artificial intelligence systems.
