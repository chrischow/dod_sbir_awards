ROBOTICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
====================================

# Abstract


EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING WILL BE INVESTIGATED AS A MEANS FOR OPTIMIZING AN ASAT BATTLE MANAGEMENT SCENARIO. EVOLUATIONARY PROGRAMMING IS A STOCHASTIC PROCESS, SIMULATING DARWINIAN EVOLUTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCOVERING THE MOST APPROPRIATE LOGIC FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM AS POSED. RELATIVELY FEW UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE REQUIRED. SIMULATED EVOLTION WILL BE PROGRAMMED IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EVOLUTIONARMY PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE USING A SUITABLE COMBAT SIMULATION. EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING WILL BE COMPARED IN EFFICIENCY TO THE GENETIC EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM.
