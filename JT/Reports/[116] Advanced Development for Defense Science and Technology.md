# Abstract


Conflict Kinetics proposes to develop a Close Quarter Marksmanship next generation training platform, the Adaptive Panoramic TORA (TORA Apan 220), that will be fully automated and self diagnostic.  It will guide soldiers through drills and trigger corrective drills that address deficiencies identified in their marksmanship skills.  The Phase II effort will include the following objectives: modify the TORA Apan 220 to be fully operable by the shooter, develop adaptive drill set - algorithm techniques, develop data mining / machine learning techniques, develop additional data capture to drive machine learning, design the TORA Apan 220 that is robust, stable and deployable to military locations.
