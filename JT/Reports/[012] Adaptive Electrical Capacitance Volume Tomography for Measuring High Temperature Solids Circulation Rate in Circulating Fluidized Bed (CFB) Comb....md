# Abstract


Next generation power systems require greater flexibility in their operations for meeting the higher efficiency  and lower emissions conditions that are geared toward meeting consumer demand and adhering to increased regulatory standards, simultaneously. Devices that can accurately measure the solid flow rate of an operating multi-phase flow system would be of great aid for optimizing and controlling the energy generation processes in advanced reactors. Presently, the availability of such devices, particularly at high temperatures and pressures, is very limited. Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) has emerged as a viable technology for addressing instrumentation requirements in various energy related multi-phase flow systems. ECVT, in its basic form, is based on passive sensors that measure flow components in real-time. Advanced instrumentation requires active capacitance sensors that can change their design; toward higher measurement accuracy;  based on process variables. In this Phase II A effort, we will continue building a functional prototype of an Adaptive Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (AECVT) system for mass-flow gauging of solids or liquids in energy reactors at high pressures and temperatures. AECVT is distinguished from ECVT in its ability to incorporate intelligence in the sensor formations. This feature enables the sensors to change their design, electronically, toward higher measurement resolution. It also allows artificial intelligence algorithms to be incorporated in instrumentations that use AECVT sensors. Using AECVT, mass flow measurements at 5% spatial resolution and 1 Hz temporal resolution will be possible. Phase II A will address further R&D activities required to develop the first prototype. On Phase I and II, the electronic hardware was developed and fabricated for the first adaptive system. Phase II A involve testing of the developed hardware, intelligent algorithm development, and fabrication of high temperature/pressure adaptive sensor for demonstration, software development with graphical user interface, and testing of fully integrated demonstration system. Benefits of this technology include spurring economic growth by introducing a new intelligent instrumentation to the market, helping the advancement of energy generation process by providing accurate real-time flow information to process operators, increasing efficiencies in various energy generating processes, and controlling emissions for safer operation of energy plants.
