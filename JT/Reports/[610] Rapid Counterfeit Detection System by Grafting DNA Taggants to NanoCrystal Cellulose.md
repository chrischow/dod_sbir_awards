Rapid Counterfeit Detection System by Grafting DNA Taggants to NanoCrystal Cellulose
====================================================================================

# Abstract


Prixarc will develop and commercialize a secure and rapid counterfeit detection system using botanical DNA taggants grafted to NanoCrystal Cellulose (NCC) to safeguard electronic components in supply chains and to protect against counterfeiting and diversion. We will advance the science behind grafting of botanical DNA taggants to NCC, along with its application to semiconductors and microchips. Our counterfeit detection system is based on the random color pattern formed by the duplexed DNA-NCC hybrid material. The random pattern which is unique to every tag cannot be replicated or reengineered or counterfeited. Further, the random pattern once formed as a solid NCC thin film retains the pattern throughout its life. Machine learning algorithms will be developed to quickly identify microscale optical iridescent/fluorescence patterns and the design of the rapid detection system based on polarized optical microscopy. At the front-end, our detection system only requires a circular polarized Ultra-Violet (UV) light for reading the tag. The back-end of the detection system is protected by a sophisticated machine learning algorithm and a database system that takes advantage of the random distribution of the DNA taggants within NCC film during grafting and the tag manufacturing. In Phase I, we will conduct analysis, design, and fabrication of hybrid DNA-NCC tags. The feasibility study is expected to include the following items: 1) read and interpret signature hybrid DNA-NCC tags with a yield of greater than 95%, 2) incorporate artificial intelligent (AI) machine learning to predict issues of counterfeiting, and 3) distinguish between defect-free hybrid DNA-NCC tags and one with defects included.
