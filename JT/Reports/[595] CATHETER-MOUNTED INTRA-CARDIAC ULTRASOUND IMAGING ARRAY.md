# Abstract


Not Available  Few automated tools are currently available to rapidly analyze a potential course of action to determine a plan's weakness and strengths.  The proposed effort seeks to identify artificial intelligence type tools/techniques that can be used within a planning system to enable a better understanding of a particular course of action.  Orion Scientific Systems proposes to combine our proven expertise in developing automated information retrieval and data analysis systems with modern planning technologies to address several areas of weakness in the strategic and tactical planning environment: Important operation planning requires the collection and synthesis of increasingly complex forms of data from a large variety of sources.  Critical capabilities, special personnel, and unique forms of equipment are constantly under development, yet no centrally accessible database is maintained on their number, location, attributes, abilities or availability. Situations requiring a quick operations response are continually faced with the inability to adequately review or build upon records of past operation, events, options, decision, successes and failures.  Executives, commanders and other crucial personnel move within and rotate out of the military community with little or no effort made to develop or maintain an institutional memory.
