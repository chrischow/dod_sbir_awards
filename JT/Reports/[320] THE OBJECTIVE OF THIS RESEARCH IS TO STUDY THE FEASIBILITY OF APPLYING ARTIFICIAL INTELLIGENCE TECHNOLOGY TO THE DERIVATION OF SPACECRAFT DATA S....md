# Abstract


THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY TO THE DERIVATION OF SPACECRAFT DATA SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FROM USER SCENARIOS. DURING PHASE I THE RESEARCH WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FORMAL NOTATION FOR THE EXPRESSION OF SCENARIOS WHICH ALLOWS THE USER THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY IN DESCRIBING HIS USE OF THE SYSTEM. THIS NOTATION WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED. THE EXPERT SYSTEM WHICH SUPPORTS THIS NOTATION IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE PROSPECTIVE COMPUTER SYSTEM USER IN ENTERING HIS SCENARIOS, AND TO THE SYSTEMS ENGINEER IN ESTABLISHING AN OPERATIONS CONCEPT AND EXTRACTING REQUIREMENTS. THE RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO A DESIGN CONCEPT AND A PROTOTYPE EXPERT SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE FURTHER DEVELOPED IN PHASE II.
